Training:

* Systematic - planned, organized, measured, specific goal
* Disciplined - actually follow plan and measure results
* Science based - draw from existing knowledge, experiment

Why train?

* Continuous improvement - can't break plateau without data/feedback
* Injury prevention - systematic controlled overload vs climbing randomly
* Rehab - similarly 
* Efficiency - maximize improvement per hour spent
* Motivation - much easier to push hard if you can see results

Goal-setting:

* Well-defined, inspiring long-term goals
* Intermediate goals to provide progress feedback
* Short-term goal for each day of training to provide focus
* Use training plan as coach to provide both motivation and restraint

Skill development:

* Deliberate practice - pay attention, seek feedback
* Keep moving - aim for mileage, be actually climbing >50% of shoes-on time
* Practice new skills in stress-free environment
* Pick projects that can be redpointed in at most a few days
* Repeat projects until they are perfect
* Target weaknesses
* Progressive practice - practice moves under increasingly stressful situations

Footwork

* Plan foot sequences as well as hand sequences
* Practice on tiny footholds eg bolt holes
* Don't practice in old floppy shoes
* Make many foot movements, ~3:1 foot:hand
* Watch foot placement 
* Apply consistent pressure as you move - variation leads to slipping
* Seek out technical face and slab routes

Rests:

* Practice weighting feet and relaxing hands
* Foot-squat
* Hand-foot stem

Climbing drills:

* Straight arms
* Rest practice
* Speed climbing
* Finding calm
* Movement perfection
* Momentum climbing

Leg drills:

* Stutter step - 3:1 foot:hand
* Thumbs only
* Downclimb - avoid large foot movements
* Toe hard - make long reaches, maximize foot force
* Pull feet - toe in on steep routes

Footwork drills:

* Precision feet - pick a bullseye and hit it first time
* Foot stab
* Blinking - close eyes just before feet land and check feel
* Jibs only - avoid large holds
* Glue feet - flex ankle instead of rotating

Dynamic drills:

* Two points of contact - one leg off before hand move
* One-arm traverse
* Blind dynos
* Pocket dynos
* Target campusing
* Deadpoints
