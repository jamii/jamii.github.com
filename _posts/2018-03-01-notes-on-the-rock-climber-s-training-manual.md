Training:

* Systematic - planned, organized, measured, specific goal
* Disciplined - actually follow plan and measure results
* Science based - draw from existing knowledge, experiment

Why train?

* Continuous improvement - can't break plateau without data/feedback
* Injury prevention - systematic controlled overload vs climbing randomly
* Rehab - similarly 
* Efficiency - maximize improvement per hour spent
* Motivation - much easier to push hard if you can see results

Goal-setting:

* Well-defined, inspiring long-term goals
* Intermediate goals to provide progress feedback
* Short-term goal for each day of training to provide focus
* Use training plan as coach to provide both motivation and restraint

Skill development:

* Deliberate practice - pay attention, seek feedback
* Keep moving - aim for mileage, be actually climbing >50% of shoes-on time
* Practice new skills in stress-free environment
* Pick projects that can be redpointed in at most a few days
* Repeat projects until they are perfect
* Target weaknesses
* Progressive practice - practice moves under increasingly stressful situations

Footwork

* Plan foot sequences as well as hand sequences
* Practice on tiny footholds eg bolt holes
* Don't practice in old floppy shoes
* Make many foot movements, ~3:1 foot:hand
* Watch foot placement 
* Apply consistent pressure as you move - variation leads to slipping
* Seek out technical face and slab routes

Rests:

* Practice weighting feet and relaxing hands
* Foot-squat
* Hand-foot stem

Climbing drills:

* Straight arms
* Rest practice
* Speed climbing
* Finding calm
* Movement perfection
* Momentum climbing

Leg drills:

* Stutter step - 3:1 foot:hand
* Thumbs only
* Downclimb - avoid large foot movements
* Toe hard - make long reaches, maximize foot force
* Pull feet - toe in on steep routes

Footwork drills:

* Precision feet - pick a bullseye and hit it first time
* Foot stab
* Blinking - close eyes just before feet land and check feel
* Jibs only - avoid large holds
* Glue feet - flex ankle instead of rotating

Dynamic drills:

* Two points of contact - one leg off before hand move
* One-arm traverse
* Blind dynos
* Pocket dynos
* Target campusing
* Deadpoints

Training principles:

* Specificity
* Overload - much easier with quantifiable training
* Recovery -> super-compensation -> detraining
* Regularity
* Progression - regular overload leads to increasing baseline
* Variation - at seasonal level switching styles of climbing does the job
* Individualization
* Transfer eg if training for competition, try to train at same time of day, intensity, temperature etc

Training process:

* Quantification
* Documentation
* Intensity
* Duration
* Volume = intensity * duration, or area under curve
* Isolation - so much variation in demand between routes that isolated training makes more sense than complex movement training for strength
* Hard work / discomfort
* Focus
  * Eliminate distractions
  * Use music to set mental state
  * Place inspiring photos/messages/goals nearby
  * Start controlled breathing before training and continue throughout
  * Consistent routine to prepare
  * Keep eyes focused on training
* Train to failure
* Split training - cycle targeted systems to allow recovery

Focus on finger strength, because it's always a limiting factor eventually and it takes a long time to increase.

Physiology:

* (Repeats basics from Self-Coached Climber)
* Low-frequency fatigue - low-intensity workloads can be sustained for longer but take longer to recover from - up to multiple days.
* Different fatigue mechanisms => different training methods for different climbing goals
* Blood-flow occlusion - muscle contraction reduces blood-flow - exacerbated by raising arms above head
* Muscles need ATP to relax as well as to contract, so they can get stuck
* Pump = blood-flow occlusion + stuck muscle fibers
* Fight pump with strength (less effort per move), grip control (less wasted effort) and arcing (better blood flow)

Base fitness:

* Ramp up from rest period
* Mileage
* ARCing
  * Climb 20+ minutes
  * Aim for moderate but sustainable pump
  * Start with harder route and then reduce difficulty to maintain pump
  * Expect progress to be gradual
  * If you can find a partner try ARC-leading
  * Focus on calm, relaxed movement
  * Listen to soothing music
* Why ARC?
  * Improve capillarization
  * Improve mitochondria
  * Practice grip control
  * Speed recovery by flushing muscles
  * Practice movement technique
* Can safely schedule ARCing on days after more intense training days

Strength:

* Gains come from:
  * Hypertrophy (but also increased weight)
  * Neurological adaptations (more recruitment, less inhibition, better coordination of firing)
* Neurological gains peak plateau after a few weeks
* Hypertrophy takes much longer, but continues after strength training phase
* Isometric strength training
  * More effective for increasing strength at specific joint angles
  * Specificity is +/- ~15 degrees
  * Use for finger strength and lock-offs
  * Multiple brief reps better than one long rep
  * High-freq fatigue sets in ~6-7s
  * Recovery in ~2s
  * 3-10s, 15-20 reps
* Isotonic strength training
  * More effective at increasing strength across all joint angles
  * Use for upper-body training, pinches (because width varies), latching dynos, crimp rollups and improving power
  * Much debate over sets and reps
  * For power - 1-3 sets, 3-5 reps, 3-5m rest
  * For strength-endurance - 2-4 sets, 12-20 reps, 30-60s rest
* Hangboard
  * Dead-hang, with elbows/shoulders engaged but not pulling up
  * Smoothly transfer weight to avoid injury
  * Use pulley to remove weight, or harness to add weight
  * Take current body weight into account when adding weight
  * Choose <10 grips to work for the season and train same grips each session
  * Use a fan to keep the board dry
  * 2+ days of rest between sessions
* Other exercises
  * Explosive pullups on free-hanging rings
  * One-arm inverted row
  * Lock-off laps - juggy overhang, lockoff each move one-handed for 2 breaths, downclimb same way
  * Pushups
  * Shoulder press
  * Dips
  * Hanging leg raises - alternate forwards vs 30 degrees to side
  * Lateral-to-front raise
  * Bicep curl

Power:

* = strength * speed
* Gains come from:
  * Recruitment - more muscle fibers at once
  * More fast-twitch muscles
  * Faster slow-twitch muscles
* Plyometric training
  * Eccentric -> concentric contraction
  * Triggers defensive recruitment to protect against stretching
  * Has to be fast - <0.2s in transition
* Limit bouldering
  * 1-2 almost-impossible moves
  * Days to send, not minutes
* Campusing
  * Non-stop movement, no pausing or adjusting
  * Very high injury risk - don't train if at all damaged
  * Requires long rest period, up to 2 days
  * 1 work : 20 rest
  * Ladders
    * Matching
    * Alternating
    * Max reach
    * Typewriters
    * Bumps - max move then continue bumping with reaching hand
    * Touches - try to descend slowly
    * Double dyno
    * Down-and-up
* Power training should be explosive, max effort/focus/intensity
* As soon as fatigued, stop training and go home

Power-endurance:

* Sustained power - bouts of 30-180s of near-maximal exertion
* Gains come from improving aerobic pathways (eg more, bigger, better mitochondria)
* Endurance training is specific:
  * Specific to grip type
  * Low-intensity endurance training (eg arcing) only trains slow-twitch, also need high-intensity training to train fast-switch
  * Tradeoff between intensity and duration/repetition to match climbing goals for the season
* Start at 2 rest : 1 work and aim for 1 rest : 1 work
* Linked bouldering circuit
  * 1-4 mins / ~20 hand movements
  * Powerful, dynamic moves - training commitment under pump
  * Aim for pump to start around 3-4 reps
* Route intervals
  * Include poor rests to allow fatigue past 1-4 min PE limit
  * Ideally on lead - training clipping under pump
  * Aim one letter grade above onsight level
  * Practice route until it's an automatic send when fresh
  * Typically 3-6 reps
* Beware that indoor climbing is faster because easier to read 
  * Aim for same pace as goal route
  * Look for tricky feet or technical moves
  * Put time gates at key holds
* Traverses are easy to find at the gym, but prefer up/down climbing
* Cooldown is important for recovery - ARC after 20 mins rest 
* Can be partially replaced by redpoint attempts on project

Rest:

* Improvement is stimulated by exercise but *occurs* while resting
* Sleep
  * Don't incur sleep debt
  * Sleep extra (up to 10 hours) during leadup to projects
* Rest days
  * Don't tax muscles used in climbing
  * Aerobic exercise is ok - volume low enough so it doesn't require it's own rest days
  * Skin care, stretching, massage, icing
* Rest phase
  * Don't extend the performance phase or skip the rest phase
  * Reminiscence effect - regularization for the motor system?
  * Active rest - do non-climbing things
* End the season immediately on injury
* Skin care 
  * Sand calluses down and apply lotion to avoid flappers
  * Keep skin dry in the hours before climbing
  * Quit early rather than risk ruining the trip
  * Use extra chalk on hotspots
  
Training plans:

* Resting
  * 1 climbing day => 1 rest day
  * 2 climbing days => 2 rest days
  * 1 high-intensity training => 2 rest days
* Within each day, order exercises intense -> endurance
* Within weekend trips, order projects intense -> endurance

Weight management:

* Periodic training => periodic dieting - only need to cut weight in performance phase
* Aim for <10% fat generally and as low as 5% during performance phase
* Glycemic response
  * Low blood sugar -> lethargy + ketosis - breaking down fat for energy
  * High blood sugar -> release insulin -> convert blood glucose into glycogen (in muscle and liver) or fat
  * Overcompensates - blood sugar spike -> insulin response -> blood sugar crash -> craving for sugar -> ...
  * Goal is to keep blood sugar levels relatively constant to avoid this cycle
* Glycemic index - how quickly food breaks down into sugar
  * Small amounts of high GI foods after training help replenish glycogen
  * High GI foods on empty stomach are particularly bad
  * Doesn't take portion size into account
* Glycemic load = (GI / 100) * (carbs - dietary fiber)
  * Still only accounts for carbs eg steak has low GI/GL
* Eat food, mostly vegetables
* Find replacements for the worst parts of your diet, especially comfort foods
* Snack constantly on low-calorie foods - mostly salad
* Don't drink calories
* Take vitamin and omega-3 supplements
* Hang a picture of your project on the fridge door

Preparation:

* Pay attention to temperature, moisture, shade etc
* Route learning
  * Hangdog and stick-clip to figure out the beta
  * Practice rests too - don't rely on the rope
  * If a clip is also the crux, consider skipping it
* Beta
  * Film the beta and/or draw a map on a photo
  * Regularly review and mentally rehearse
  * Include struggle and positive self-talk in mental rehearsals
* Confidence is built on pyramids
* Warmup - 30-45 mins of climbing time, on lead - followed by 30-60 mins rest
* Pre-climb
  * Start breathing rhythm
  * Pick consistent order of preparation
  * Last round of mental rehearsal
* Post-climb
  * Review performance, ideally with video
  * Notice triggers for mistakes eg holding breath after a dyno
  * Especially triggers for negative attitude or broken focus
* Nibble throughout the day
* Warm-down on fun, rewarding routes at the end of the day

Redpoint and onsight:

* Maximize quality over quantity eg climb Sat morning and Sun evening
* Begin each burn as a redpoint attempt, only switch to learning after a fall
* Work harder moves earlier
* Work higher cruxes earlier - more likely to ruin a good attempt
* Use easy sections for warmup / cooldown
* For onsights train endurance, lock-offs, down-climbing, moving recovery
* Onsight pyramids should be flatter and all outdoors

Trad and big-wall - __skipped__

Training for bouldering:

* Less endurance training, more strength and power
* Add exercises for arm, shoulder and core strength
* Maximum arousal - get amped up
* Fight for it - no need to ration energy like on longer routes
* Use power spots to calibrate limit moves
* Rest at least 5 minutes between attempts
* Avoid working one problem more than one hour - too much stress on same moves
