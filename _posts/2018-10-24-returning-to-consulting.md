As of November, I'll be available again for consulting on systems engineering and performance optimization.

I can help you:

* process big data without building an expensive distributed system
* replace complex hand-coded data pipelines with simple declarative languages
* improve response times and reduce server expenses for your web service
* use web assembly to speed up hotspots in your web app
* train your team in Rust or Julia

> Jamie is a first principles thinker with a deep understanding of systems and algorithms. He is fearless in the way he approaches problems. Jamie’s research on staged compilation saved our team many person years of effort, and his training and support was crucial to our adoption of Julia. I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again soon.

I'm based in London and also happy to work remotely.
