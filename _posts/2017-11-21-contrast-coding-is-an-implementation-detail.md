I found [contrast codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(statistics)) really confusing until I realized that they are just an artifact of using specific analytic solutions to compare models. Let me try to explain.

A typical instance of the [General Linear Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model) looks like this:

\begin{align}
y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e
\end{align}

Where $\begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}$ is chosen to minimize error on the training data.

We want to ask questions like:

* Q1: Is knowing $x_1$ useful if we already know $x_2$?

We can answer this by comparing the prediction accuracy of this model against a simpler model:

\begin{align}
\text{full model: } & y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \cr
\text{null model: } & y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \text{ where } b_1 = 0 \cr
\end{align}

* Q1*: Does assuming that $x_1$ has no effect ($b_1 = 0$) lead to less prediction error on unseen data?

The null model is a restricted version of the full model, so it will always have at least as much error on the training data as the full model. But if that is purely due to over-fitting then the null model will probably have less error on as-yet unseen data than the full model will.

Unfortunately in psychology we [typically don't have enough data](http://datacolada.org/20) to begin with, so we can't afford to leave any data unseen. Instead we ask a different question:

* Q2: If reality behaved exactly according to the fitted null model, what is the probability that the full model would have this much less error on the training data?

In this case we can give an exact analytic answer to Q2. (Whether that answer has any bearing on the answer to Q1 is another, much more complicated matter).

So where do contrast codes come in?

Suppose we are testing a drug and measuring some patient outcome $y$. We want to know the answer to:

* Q1: Do patients in the treatment group have better outcomes than patients in the control group?

If we code the data as $X=\begin{pmatrix}1\\\0\end{pmatrix}$ for subjects in the treatment group and $X=\begin{pmatrix}0\\\1\end{pmatrix}$ for subjects in the control group, we can rephrase this question as:

\begin{align}
\text{full model: } & y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \cr
\text{null model: } & y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \text{ where } b_1 = b_2 \cr
\end{align}

* Q1*: Does assuming that the treatment group and the control group have the same outcome distribution ($b_1 = b_2$) lead to less prediction error on unseen data?

Again, answering this question is hard so we're going to substitute a different question:

* Q2: If reality behaved exactly according to the fitted null model, what is the probability that the full model would have this much less error on the training data?

Unfortunately the nice analytic answer __only works for constraints of the form $b_i = 0$__. To apply it here, we need to [transform the problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis) so that it has the same form as the previous problem.

If we define:

\begin{align}
L & = \begin{pmatrix}1 & {-1}\\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix} \cr
\begin{pmatrix}c_1 & c_2\end{pmatrix} & = \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix} L^{-1} \cr
\end{align}

Then we get:

\begin{align}
\text{full model: } y & = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \cr
  & = a + \begin{pmatrix}c_1 & c_2\end{pmatrix} L \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e  \cr
  & = a + \begin{pmatrix}c_1 & c_2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x_1 - x_2\\\x_1 + x_2\end{pmatrix} + e  \cr
\text{null model: } y & = a + \begin{pmatrix}c_1 & c_2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x_1 - x_2\\\x_1 + x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \text{ where } c_1 = 0 \cr
\end{align}

Now we can apply the same analytic solution as before.

The rows of $L$ are called __contrast codes__. But where do they come from? Well, I picked $\begin{pmatrix}1 & {-1}\end{pmatrix}$ for the first row because I wanted to restrict the null model to $(1)b_1 + (-1)b_2 = 0$, and I picked whatever second row would make $L$ invertible. 

This method works in general as long as $L$ has full rank. Otherwise we are throwing away some dimension of the data, or, equivalently, we are imposing some restriction on $b_i$ in the full model. 

(Textbooks tend to insist that $L$ be orthogonal too. I *think* the reason for this is that if you can pack all the questions you want to ask into a single orthogonal matrix then the resulting tests will be independent of each other. It doesn't seem to be necessary for single comparisons.)

None of this changes the fact the comparison we actually care about is still:

\begin{align}
\text{full model: } & y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \cr
\text{null model: } & y = a + \begin{pmatrix}b_1 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\x_2\end{pmatrix} + e \text{ where } b_1 = b_2 \cr
\end{align}

Contrast codes are just an implementation detail by which we transform the comparison we care about into a comparison we can easily calculate the answer to. The typical presentation of the subject totally obscures this.
