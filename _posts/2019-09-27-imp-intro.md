title: Imp: Intro
---

I'm working on a programming environment called Imp. The vision is of an emacs-y live self-modifying environment for working with structured data across multiple devices. The big moving parts are:

* a versioned relational database
* an extensible GUI
* a pure programming language built around relations
* an interpreter with fast incremental view maintenance

This was also the subject of [several](/blog/2016/10/11/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/) [older](/blog/2017/07/28/relational-ui/) [projects](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2019/02/05/reltron/) which I hope to elegantly superglue together.

Here is the story so far:

* [Intro](/blog/2019/09/27/imp-intro/)
* Sets and functions (coming soon...)
