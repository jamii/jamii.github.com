Pseudo-work - looks like working, isn't effective

Work = time * focus

## Time management
  * Carry list to write down todos
  * Every morning:
    * Move todos to some day on calendar
    * Schedule time for all of todays todos
  
## Procrastination
  * Every evening, write down any failed todos and reasons
  * Hydrate, eat well, don't abuse caffeine
  * Make an event out of worst tasks
    * Tell people in advance
    * Isolated location
    * No distractions
  * Habit - find a one hour slot per day that is always distraction-free, always use it for the same task
  * If overtime is likely, schedule in advance and make an event

## Notes
  * Keep every handout, in one place
  * Nontechnical notes:
    * Identify main ideas - question, evidence, conclusion
  * Technical notes:
    * Record as many sample problems as possible
    * In priority order:
      * Problem statement and answer
      * Ask questions for anything confusing
      * Record solution steps
      * Annotate steps with explanation
  * Discussion notes:
    * No main ideas, so just record anything insightful
  * Eliminate question marks
    * Ask questions in class
    * Talk to teacher after class
    * Ask classmates
    * Ask the internet

## Assignments
  * Work constantly - any free time during working hours should be used to stay ahead
  * Don't read everything - prioritize favored sources
  * [Learn to read](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2016/08/15/notes-on-how-to-read-a-book/)
  * Prime problems
  * Collect stuck problems for TA, office hours, group sessions

## Retaining
  * Study early, in isolation, with hourly breaks
  * Collect questions and problems from notes
  * Answer out loud or on paper
  * Remove easy questions
  * Repeat until no questions left
  
## Memorizing
  * Use flash cards
  * Train in odd moments eg bus journeys, queues, between classes

## Papers
  * Pick a topic
  * Get a second opinion eg prof - is this a reasonable plan
  * Skim and annotate sources, follow citations
  * Create argument outline
  * Annotate outline with citations
  * If not enough support, goto 3
  * Fill in text
  * One pass to clean up argument structure
  * One pass out loud to clean up awkward/wrong grammar
  * One pass for sanity checking
