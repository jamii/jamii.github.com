I'm happy to report that I'm maintaining my commitment to viewing every problem as an incremental view maintenance problem by joining an [incremental view maintenance startup](https://materialize.io/).

Tradition dictates that I now convince the reader that You Too Can Join An Incremental View Maintenance Startup. So here are the some of the things that I found compelling:

* Experience. Everyone involved so far has built similar systems in the past, so we can skip past all the obvious mistakes and make fresh new exciting mistakes.
* Sensible engineering. From the folks that brought you [Scalability! But at what COST?](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf) and [Jepsen-approved serializability](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-beta-passes-jepsen-testing/).
* Low hype. We're not Changing The Way The World Brushes Their Teeth. We're just trying to build a thing that works, in a field where [most things don't work](https://jepsen.io/analyses).
* People go home in the evening. Half of the company have families. There isn't any beer pong.
* Open pay scale. Pinned to market levels (as determined by some incredibly expensive watermarked spreadsheet).
* Explicit vacation guidelines. At numbers that won't make Europeans laugh in pity.

Other points are still in flux but seem likely to include some variation on 20% time, as well as some other friendly details which I'm happy to talk about privately but probably shouldn't commit the company to publicly.
