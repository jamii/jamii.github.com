__These notes are very sparse because I have been procrastinating on this forever and need to get it out the door so I can move on to other notes.__

__Reads as if every chapter was an independent paper - so lots of repeated content.__

Built a university from scratch, free from prior mixed incentives and power structures.

Syllabus: 

* First year - list of ~100 habits, framed as trigger-action pairs
* Second/third year - choose from cohesive set of modules rather than whatever prof wants
* Fourth year - list interests, , design your own syllabus with support of advisor
  
Online:

* Flipped classrooms - reading beforehand, discussion/exercises in online classroom
* Teacher has tools for guiding class eg form groups of three, who has spoken least.
* Tools can be triggered from lesson plan too
* Lesson plans designed with goal of >75% engagement. Whenever one person talking, lesson plan says what all the other students should be doing.
* Teacher reviews and annotates video afterwards for grading
* No campus, use local facilities => 1/2 price of ivy league despite much more contact time
  
Social:

* Cohorts of dunbars number
* Live together in different world cities each year
* Various social nudges to encourage tight network rather than cliques
 
__Feels like a dramatic improvement on traditional education, although the actual assessment of this is not strong.__

__If I taught, the book might be very useful. As it is, it's still interesting as an example of the stark difference between [actually trying](http://lesswrong.com/lw/uh/trying_to_try/) vs just going through the motions. Eg it's well known that retention from passive lectures is terrible, but most schools still rely almost entirely on passive lectures for teaching.__
