title: 'Notes on ''Data Analysis: A Model Comparison Approach To Regression, ANOVA, and Beyond'''

Model comparison is certainly an improvement over the old-school zoo of tests, but this book still manages to over-complicate plenty. (It was the impetus for me writing [Contrast codes are an implementation detail](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2017/11/21/contrast-coding-is-an-implementation-detail/), for example.) It was a course text and my [course notes](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2017/12/12/notes-on-psycgr01-statistics/) cover all the actual content. This post is just to warn people off the book itself.

I see two reasonable approaches to writing a statistics textbook:

* Rigorously prove everything
* Focus on intuition and model-building

This book takes the worst of both. It leaves software tools to the appendix, perhaps assuming that we prefer to use a hand calculator as required by the exam. It drowns the reader in equations but never bothers to derive them, or any of the underlying theory. It's a sort of cargo-cult dedication to rigor, where the more LaTeX we use the more rigorous the book is.
