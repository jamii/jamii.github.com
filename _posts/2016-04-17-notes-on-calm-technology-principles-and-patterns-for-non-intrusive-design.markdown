I really wanted to like this book, but it spends page after page applying basic fill-in-the-blank HCI principles while totally ignoring the fact that the problem is not that the highly paid designers at big tech companies don't understand these principles - it's that they are paid to optimize for distraction and addiction, not for calm.

I don't need a book to tell me not to drown people in notifications. I need a book to tell me how to make people care.
