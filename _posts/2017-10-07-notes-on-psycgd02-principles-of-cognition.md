<https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lifesciences-faculty-php/courses/viewcourse.php?coursecode=PSYCGD02>

>  This module outlines general theoretical principles that underlie cognitive processes across many domains, ranging from perception to language, to reasoning and decision making. The focus will be on general, quantitative regularities, and the degree to which theories focusing on specific cognitive scientific topics can be constrained by such principles. There will be an introduction on general methods and approaches in cognitive science and some of the problems related to them. Later in the course, some computational approaches in cognitive science will be discussed. There will be particular emphasis on understanding cognitive principles that are relevant to theories of decision making.  

## [What is Cognitive Science?](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.645.8834&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Brief history. 

Notable that the narrative revolves around several key conferences where prominent figures from different fields became aligned.

## [Bridging Levels of Analysis for Probabilistic Models of Cognition](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.704.2311&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Levels of models:

* Computational - problem and declarative solution eg Bayesian inference
* Algorithmic - representation and constructive solution eg message passing
* Implementation - physical processes eg neurons

Popular research method is to look at where people diverge from ideal solutions, to figure out what algorithms their mind is using to approximate the solution. But..
.
* Vulnerable to misidentifying the computational problem being solved.
  * eg strategies for iterated PD look irrational in single PD
* Requires understanding how levels constrain each other
  * eg are probalistic models fundamentally incompatible with connectionist models or can we implement one on top of the other?

Rational process models - identify algorithm for approximating probabilistic inference under time/space limits, compare to what we know about mind and behavior.

* Bridges computational and algorithmic levels.
* Constrains possible algorithms to those that produce ideal behavior in limit.
* Explains many cases where individuals deviate but average behavior is close to ideal.

Example - Monte Carlo with small number of samples is tractable. Consistent with:

* Averaging multiple guesses from one person increases accuracy (ie contains some independent error)
* Recall similar events ~= importance sampling. __Predicts availability bias? Incorrect re-weighting?__
* Order effects (order of information incorrectly affects results of update) ~= particle filter.
* Perceptual bistability ~= random walk. 

Some progress in bridging to implementation level eg neural models of importance sampling.

## [Lecture 1](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/4302613/mod_resource/content/2/Lecture%201.pdf)

Cognitive science as reverse engineering - understand how the mind works by trying to build one and see what differs.

Brief history:

* Structuralism
  * Building blocks are qualia
  * Learning via systematic introspection
    * Controlled, replicable experiments
    * But different labs struggled to replicate each others results
    * Difficult to relate conscious experiences which don't match qualia (eg non-visual mental models)
    * Vulnerable to observer effects, confirmation, priming, retroactive justification
    * Introspection actually = retrospection
    * eg visual illusions, choice blindness
* Behaviorism
  * Only talk about observable stimulus and response
  * Mostly experiments with animal learning
  * eg classic conditioning (event -> event -> response => event -> ... -> response)
  * eg operant conditioning (action -> +/- => +/- action)
  * Reinforcement machines, not reasoning machines
  * Doesn't allow internal state/structure
    * Doesn't explain how stimulus/response are categorized - theoryless learning
    * But language has infinite structure => can't be learned from stimulus/response without hyperpriors
    * Rats choose shorted route available, rather than most reinforced route
* Cognitive science
  * Thought as computation / information processing - data + algorithms
  * __We needed to invent computation first to be able to have this idea!__
  
Methods: 
  
* Behavioral studies
* Lesion studies
* Single-cell recordings
* fMRI
  * Neural activity -> blood de-oxygenation -> magnetic interaction changes -> measure with big magnets
  * Spatial resolution ~1mm
  * Temporal resolution ~seconds
* EEG
  * Neural activity -> electromagnetic field -> measure with electrodes on scalp
  * Can only measure large fields
  * Spatial resolution ~poor
  * Temporal resolution ~1ms
* MEG
  * Neural activity -> electromagnetic field -> measure with ?
  * Spatial resolution ~better
  * Temporal resolution ~1ms
* tDCS

Review:

* Recount three main periods of history.
* Explain levels of models, with examples.

## [Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.333.7523&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

(Paired with the more recent failed replication.)

Arguing that non-conscious priming can strongly affect behavior.

Experiment 1:

* 34 undergrads
* Use scrambled sentence test with words that prime rude/polite/neutral
* All experimenters blinded
* Sent to another room for next test, where waiting confederate is asking experimenter questions
* Time how long it takes them to interrupt
* Huge effect sizes: almost 2x mean time, <20% vs >60% interruptions within 10min cutoff
* No significant differences in reported perceptions of experimenters politeness
* __Should we trust reports of politeness? It's a bad idea to call your professor rude!__
* __Effect sizes are enormous. If a few words can double impatience, what could listening to angry music on the journey do? If we're so strongly susceptible to small influences, how is there room for personality? How do we have any resistance to marketing?__

Experiment 2:

* Two successful iterations!
* 30 + 30 undergrads
* Same setup, but priming elderly/neutral (without priming slow)
* Timed how long subjects took to walk to the next room
* Much smaller effect size - mean 7.30s -> 8.28s
* __Near identical results in both iterations!__
* __Elderly -> slow? I get thinking about rudeness making me rude, but thinking about elderly making me slow seems a much bigger stretch. Thinking about predators makes me want to eat meat? Being chased by a tiger and stop for a steak sandwich?__
* Followup experiment with 19 undergrads found only 1 noticed the elderly priming

* 33 undergrads
* Do elderly priming, then Affect-Arousal Scale
* Primed group were in slightly more positive mood, but not significantly
* __Uses this to defend against the idea that they walked slower because sad, but seems bizarre that they are affected so much that they move differently but not so much that they feel differently.__

Experiment 3:

* 41 non-African-American undergrads
* Long boring computer task. 
* Flash either African-American or Caucasian face before each trial. 
* On 130th claim error and say they have to start again. Experimenter explains error, but is blinded.
* Facial expression caught by camera and rated by blinded experimenter.
* Only two subjects reported seeing the faces when asked and couldn't identify which they saw
* __Both experimenter in room and raters of pictures gave near-identical results!__
* But no difference in self-reported racial prejudice.

Argues that this works where subliminal adverts for pepsi don't because they directly activate traits which contain behavior whereas pepsi just activates the pepsi representation. __So elderly -> walk slow but pepsi -/> drink pepsi?__ Also because there is some activation energy to get up and buy coke, whereas they setup situations where the action was already required and the only difference was in accessibility. So priming for hostility will make people more likely to react to an annoying trigger but not to be randomly hostile.

Note that results for behavior here are stronger than their previous results for judgments, but would assume that judgments mediate behavior. But in ex1 there was no effect on perception of the experimenter. And little evidence so far for judgment mediating behavior.

## [Behavioral Priming: Itâ€™s all in the Mind, but Whose Mind?](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081)

Failed replication of previous paper.

Reasons to doubt original:

* Only two indirect replications.
* Small sample sizes.
* Evidence from neuroscience suggests that top-down attention and bottom-up saliency are both required for the spreading activations that are used to explain priming. 
* Experimenter who administered the task was not blinded enough - authors found that it was easy to accidentally glimpse the task sheet (__original describes them as being in a closed envelope?__)
* Measuring time with a stopwatch is susceptible to bias
* Not clear exactly what participants where asked afterwards - aware of stimulus vs aware of response vs aware of link.

Experiment 1:

* 120 (French) undergrads
* Task sheets in a closed envelope, opened by subjects
* Experimenters assigned to subjects are random
* Experimenters follow a strict script
* Walking speed recorded by infrared beam
* No significant difference in walking times
* Four students reported being aware of the elderly-ness
* Primed group chose pictures of old people significantly more often in forced choice test
* No experimenters reported having any specific expectations about subject behavior

Experiment 2:

* 50 subjects, 10 experimenters
* Half of experimenters told that primed participants will walk slower, other half told faster
* Experimenters were unblinded
* First subject for each experimenter was a confederate who behaved to confirm this expectation
* Experimenters measured with stopwatch
* For stopwatch times, fast+prime went faster and slow+prime went slower.
* For infrared times, slow+prime went slightly slower and fast+prime was same as fast+control.

Most subjects were aware of the prime (__but it said 6%...__) and are in psych course so might be expected to be suspicious. 

__Priming via social cues is way more believable to me than priming via word choice. Clear selective pressure for understanding and reacting to social cues.__

## [Lecture 2](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3694895/mod_resource/content/3/Scientific Reasoning.pdf)

Scientific reasoning. Psi hypothesis as running example.

Base-rate fallacy vs significance testing.

Successful replication could just mean replicating the mistakes of the original.

In a replication aim to improve on original methods or test some new factor - more likely to be received in good faith and more likely to generate new insight beyond back-and-forth.

A good successfully replication can falsify a hypothesis by more accurately identifying the mechanism behind the effect eg previous paper replicated slow walking, but showed that the effect disappeared under proper blinding.

Defenses of priming:

* Hidden moderators
* Experienced researchers

But:

* Then the original effect is less powerful/robust than claimed 
* Post-hoc reasoning - just a hypothesis until tested
* Administering questionnaires is not that hard
* Most of the legwork is done by grad students anyway

Try to structure experiments with multiple competing hypotheses where any given result would support some hypothesis and weaken the others.

Review:

* What should an ideal replication aim to do?

## [The Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Memory Since H.M.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/981b/7074fcb20d0b1366c7a0d2660085ddbcf465.pdf)

Intro:

* Current categories used in memory took time to establish - non-obvious.
* Specific impairments from lesions rather than general degradation shows that brain is structured and specialized.

Hippocampus:

* Hippocampal volume reduction of ~40% is common in memory-impaired patients - may be maximum cell loss ie 60% remaining is just dead tissue.
* Damage to other regions can also impair memory.

HM:

* Learned a motor skill => memory not one single unit
* Reasoning and perception intact => memory not required for reasoning/perception
* Could sustain attention and had short-term recall => damaged ares not required for working memory
* Had memories from before surgery => long-term storage not in damaged areas

Other patients:

* Perceptual priming still works
* Can learn in Bayesian fashion, but not explicit memorization
* Learned skills are rigid, fail if task is modified

Declarative: facts, representations, conscious recall, compare/contrast memories
Non-declarative memory: unconscious performance, black box

Visual perception:

* Initially thought to require memory in some cases, but...
* Tests accidentally benefit from memory
* Often damage to adjacent vision-processing areas
* Requires better imaging/locating of lesions to clear up confusion
  
Immediate and working memory:

* HM limited to 6 digit recall, but could maintain memory for 15 mins
* => Immediate memory not time-limited, but maintenance-limited
* Demonstrated in other patients - they do fine on tasks where distractions impair healthy subjects (working memory) but fail on tasks where distractions are fine for healthy subjects (long-term memory)
* Open question - are there tasks that can be handled by working memory but are still impaired by hippocampus damage
  * Debate around path integration - unclear whether subjects are each using same process and representation

Remote memory:

* HM initially had autobiographical memory
* (Later in life was limited to factual recall, but later MRIs also showed changes since initial event)
* Many other patients also have autobiographical memory.
* In patients without, often unclear how far damage extends and whether it might affect other areas

Working theory of long-term memory::

* Medial temporal lobes deal with creating and maintaining declarative memories
* Sensory memories stored in same area that initially processed them
  * Supported by many individual patients eg 'colorblind painter' - after damage that removed color perception, could no longer remember colors except declaratively
* Recall consists of tying all of these together
  * Supported by various fMRI studies
* Initially requires hippocampus, but over years memories reorganized, stored more permanently by changes across neocortex that tie these areas together

Structure::

* Working theory - organized by semantic categories
  * eg JBR lost memory of things identified by attributes but not things identified by function
* Recollection = what was in specific memory?
* Familiarity = was prompt in any memory?
* Hippocampus damaged patients are impaired on both old/new task (familiarity + some recollection) and free recall (recollection)
* Combine old/new with recall of which source - patients have less instances of familiarity without recall => damage is not recall only

Group studies average out individual variation - allows studying less obvious effects

## [Finding the engram](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2696/57152b4666ebd489ee54c2ab17534bb72496.pdf)

Engram def=

* Persistance - persistent physical change in brain resulting from specific experience
* Ecphory - automatic retrieval in presence of cue
* Content - reflects what happened and what can be retrived
* Dormancy - exists (but dormant) even when encoding and retrieval not active

The hunt:

* Moving target eg reconsolidation
* Many learning-related changes observed in brain eg synaptic, chemical, epigenetic. 
* Different persistence periods. 
* Not clear if related to engrams.
* Often don't predict retrieval success.
* Dominant theory - stronger connections between neurons that are active during encoding - neuronal ensemble

Sharp-wave ripple events in hippocampus:

* Multi-unit recordings in rodents, fMRI in humans
* Replay observed during tasks, resting and sleeping
* Strength of replay correlates with later retrieval performance
* Disrupting waves impairs subsequent expression
* Some progress on correlating content
* Related sensory cues may trigger replay
* Hard to observe dormancy

Tracking: 

* Non-specific lesions only caused retrieval failure when wide areas damaged => memories are distributed
  * But overtrained rats => resilient memories
  * But may have accidentally damaged hippocampus with large lesions
* Would like to lesion specific ensembles
* Tagging shows that some same neurons active during both encoding and retrieval (~10%, >chance, possibly collateral tagging during encoding)
* Neurons with higher levels of CREB are more often recruited into ensemble
* Neurons with virally over-expressed CREB are more often recruited into ensemble
* More CREB -> more excitable
* Increasing excitability via various other methods also has same effect
* Allocate-and-erase - ablating (__killing?__) artificially excitable neurons reduces retrieval performance without affecting future learning 
  * Even if only one brain region is targeted => some parts of ensemble have key roles
* Tag-and-erase - tag active neurons, apply inhibitors (__how are these targeted?__), same effect
* Worries about collateral tagging resolved:
  * Tag 1st experience
  * Silence during 2nd 
  * 2nd still learned but 1st is gone => not enough collateral tagging to interfere with 2nd task

Activating:

* Uncontrolled experiments with focal electrical stimulation during surgery
* Tag-and-manipulate / allocate-and-manipulate - re-triggers learned behavior even in unrelated contexts
* In both cases, activation seems to spread from initial site to entire ensemble
* Can create false associations:
  * Tag ensemble in context 1
  * Activate in context 2 and shock mice
  * Learned fear response in context 1
  * No fear response in context 2
* Even indirectly
  * Tag ensemble in context 1
  * Tag ensemble during shock
  * Repeatedly active both in context 2
  * Learned fear response in context 2
  * No fear response in context 1
* Artificial activation paired with chemical that inhibits reconsolidation removes association
* So far stimuli limited to fear/reward and response limited to freeze/approach/avoid - need more complex tasks to test episodic memory

## [Memory, navigation and theta rhythm in the hippocampal-entorhinal system](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d18c/c66f7f87e041dec544a0b843496085ab54e1.pdf)

__Having a lot of trouble with this paper. Needs much more time and depth.__

Navigation:

* Allocentric / map-based navigation - static representation, navigate by external landmarks
* Egocentric navigation / path integration - track motion, estimate path from origin
* Hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support both declarative memory and navigation
* Semantic memory (data independent of temporal context) ~ allocentric navigation
* Episodic memory (first-person experiences in context) ~ egocentric navigation
* Semantic memory abstracts repeated patterns in episodic memory ~ allocentric maps abstract repeated paths and observations

Implementation possibilities:

* Place cells in hippocampus - fire at specific locations in space - possibly encode position or distance?
* Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex - fire in repeating hexagonal pattern in space - different scales - possibly coordinate system?
* Head direction cells - ?
* Border cells - ?
* __This is too complicated to skim__
* Firing patterns are not simple - small changes in environment can result in large change in firing patterns - provides high-dimensional code for storing many different envs?

* Insects manage to navigate with much simpler circuits / less storage. 
* Massive excess capacity in mammals might be related to reuse for different kinds of memory.
* Might also enable 'maps' of semantic knowledge
* __cf spatial metaphors in language__
* Recognition and recall associated with unique firing patterns in that area for each object/event

* If episodic memories are stored similarly to paths through environment, might explain time-asymmetry and temporal contiguity (recalling one events makes it easier to recall other events that are nearby in time)

* 
Neuronal assembly sequences:

* __Patterns of activation in time?__
* Generated continuously even when environment and body signals are kept constant
* Can predict correct/incorrect moves in maze seconds before motor event
* Maybe used to organize episodic memory
* Are chunked, just like paths and memory
  * Limits error in long sequences
  * __Is chunking like a hash tree?__

__Some complex ideas about implementation in theta waves that I can't follow, but apparently explains:__

* Fine resolution near recalled event/location, coarse structure elsewhere
* Limited number of concurrently recalled events/locations
* Long-distance jumps between events/locations (__related to chunking?__)
* Compressed recall eg episodic recall tends to focus around highlights/lowlights rather than being linear in time
* Why episodic recall plays out in real-time - tied to same mechanism that implements subjective time tracking

__Maybe this explains why word-vec works? Are we just reverse-engineering the minds spatial relationships?__

Questions:

* Encoding/meaning of firing patterns
* Other animals have similar cells but that are not theta modulated - do they have some substitute system?
* What does the representation space look like (size, layout)?
* How does the cell layout vary between rodents and primates? Do some areas grow out of proportion?
* ?
* Does awareness of recollections require only the prefontal cortex, or also interaction with the rest of the cerebral cortex.

[The role of the hippocampus in navigation is memory](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1152/jn.00005.2017)

Place cells, grid cells etc seem to imply that the hippocampus provides navigation. Paper argues that the evidence actually shows that it provides general cognitive maps and that navigation is just one usecase.

Navigation strategies:

* Search
  * No active goal orientation
  * Just movement and goal recognition
* Target approaching
  * Orienting towards observable goal
* Guidance
  * Towards pre-calculated goal location
  * eg defined by relationship between multiple landmarks
  * Requires some spatial computation, and thereafter is just target approaching
* Wayfinding
  * Recognizing and approaching landmarks
  * Joining landmarks into route
  * Joining routes together into topological map
* Survey / metric navigation
  * Embed known routes/maps into common frame of reference
  * Supports novel routes, detours, shortcuts
  
Rats with hippocampal lesions:

* Can handle route navigation (eg turn left a T) - presumably recognition-triggered
* Can handle alternating routes - again presumably recognition-triggered - but not if delays are inserted
* Can handle guidance navigation with single route (eg water maze task - memorizing location of invisible platform relative to objects on wall - same starting point)
* Can't handle guidance navigation with multiple routes (eg water maze task with different starting points)
* Can't handle survey navigation (eg maze rotated after learning)
* May or may not be able to handle path integration
  * (and both rats and humans suck at it anyway)
  * In one experiment, humans could but rats couldn't
  * In another, rats were impaired even when visual cues existed => maybe the problem is forgetting where the goal is
  * Recording studies haven't found compelling evidence of hippocampal neurons involved in path integration
  * Grid cell firing patterns degrade in the dark => they don't work well with path integration alone
  
Humans with hippocampal lesions:

* Can navigate by reading a map
* Can handle guidance navigation and path integration, so long as fits in working memory
* Can describe routes in areas they knew before damage

Working theory: 

* Hippocampus is required for survey navigation.
* But survey navigation is sometimes used even when lower-level strategies would suffice, explaining failures on simpler tasks
  * eg when foraging for food in open field, see firing patterns in grid cells et al, see place cells fire in sequence when navigating to regular food drops, seee map updates when goal locations change
  * eg when disoriented animals reorient, they use local geometry even if prominent landmark is available
* Hippocampus probably not required for path integration, except to remember starting point and goal

Evidence that different spatial mappings are used for different tasks within the same environment.

Hippocampus maps abstract spaces:

* Rats with lesions can learn direct SR but not transitive
* Humans with lesions have higher deficits for order of events than for direct recall
* Rats with lesions can recognize odors but not recall order in which they were presented
* Interesting signals in human brains when presented with social or associative problems
* Similarly to in spatial tasks, some memory tasks engage hippocampal relational processing even when not required (__this paragraph seems to contradict itself?__)

Imaging suggests that hippocampus is not continuously involved when using cognitive maps in navigation, but only when learning or when planning/altering routes.

Speculation that hippocampus originally evolved for navigation but was co-opted for abstract relationships. (__How does hippocampus size vary across species?__).

## [Lecture 3](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/4345907/mod_resource/content/5/Memory%20and%20Navigation.pdf)

Divide into declarative vs non-declarative memory no longer seems to be carving at the joints:

* HM couldn't learn maze routes but could learn mirror drawing.
* House task - recall vs recognition of complex spatial arrangements (front doors and porches). Suddenly recall tanks for patients.
* Patients impaired at statistical learning of relationships and associations.
* Mountain task - normal when matching color/time-of-day but impaired when matching arrangement/rotation.
* Lesioned rats can detect novel objects and novel placements but can't pair placement with background context.

Pattern separator vs pattern completer. 

* Old/new task -> old/similar/new task. 
* Old people struggle at pattern separation (old vs similar). 
* CA1 responds to any difference, CA3/DG responds to degree of difference.

Patients learn facts at school, have high IQ and get good grades.

Use fMRI to detect 60% periodicity in humans when navigating => grid cells. Periodicity correlates with success on spatial memory task.

Experiment suggesting that periodicity can be observed even for abstract spaces, by pairing a coordinate system with bird pictures of varying neck and leg length.

Something analogous to space cells for time observed in rats.

__TODO figure out review__

## [Uniting the Tribes of Fluency to Form a Metacognitive Nation](https://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/alteropp09.pdf)

Theory: the difficulty of a cognitive task (from fluent to non-fluent) is used as a meta-cognitive cue that feeds into other judgments via 'naive theories' aka heuristics.

Fluency:

* Perceptual
  * Physical eg illegible text, varying contrast
  * Temporal eg briefly flashed images
* Memory
  * Retrieval eg availability heuristic
  * Encoding eg memorization techniques
* Embodied (__not connected to judgments by the references here__)
  * Facial expressions eg smiling in math class
  * Body feedback eg mirror writing 
* Linguistic
  * Phonological eg pronounceable vs unpronounceable letter strings
  * Lexical eg familiar vs unfamiliar synonyms
  * Syntactic eg sentence tree structure
  * Orthographic eg using other alphabets, 12% vs twelve percent (__reading latex?__)
* Conceptual eg priming with structurally similar explanations, semantic coherence
* Spatial reasoning eg rotating shapes (__not connected to judgments by the references here__)
* Imagery eg imagining hypothetical scenarios
* Decision eg jam choices 

Judgments:

* Truth
* Liking
* Confidence

Discounting - if fluency is recognized, subject corrects and may even over-correct.

__Seems like discounting provides a lot of adjustment room in this theory. How to falsify? Could try varying eg legibility over a wide scale and looking for a discounting effect.__

## [Lecture 4](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3716951/mod_resource/content/3/Mental%20construction%20slides.pdf)

Fluency can induce:

* familiarity 
* likability
* dis-likability (but not replicated).
* perception of light or darker image (but not replicated)
* judgments of fame (abolished by eating popcorn)
* judgments of danger (abolished by eating popcorn)
* volume of background noise

Familiarity seems like a reasonable heuristic - exposure => fluency, so assume fluency => exposure. 

Explanation for the popcorn is that it prevents subvocalisation so can't judge pronunciation fluency of words.

Others make less sense to me.

__Notable that the class was typically split when asked to predict outcome of experiments ie proposed mechanism is so vague that either outcome is plausible.__

Other 'constructs':

* Subjects reconstruct past to create useful narratives
* Subjects claim even under strong pressure to remember seeing events that only their partner saw
* Subjects remember seeing words when only related words were present

__Not worth reviewing, not confident in results.__
