## [On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect](https://www.dc.uba.ar/materias/incc/2015/c2/practicas/p1/The%20Deliberation-Without_Attention.pdf)

Unconscious Thought Theory

Theory is that conscious thought is sub-optimal for decisions with many aspects because it can only focus on a few things at a time.

Experiment 1:

* Simple car choice (4 aspects) vs complex car choice (12 aspects)
* Car 1 75% positive aspects, cars 2+3 50%, car 4 25%
* Conscious thought - think for 4 mins. Unconscious thought - distracted for 4 mins by anagrams.
* Conscious thinkers won in simple choice but lost in complex choice (where win = pick 75%)
* __Not blinded__
* __Assumption that 75% is the right choice - maybe the one good aspect is important. Are they subsets?__
* __Assumes students bring no outside knowledge in. Were there names or pictures?__

Experiment 2:

* Same, but asked for opinion instead and measured opinion diff

Experiment 3:

* Survey to ask what aspects people would take into consideration for 40 different products
* 49 students asked how much time the spent thinking about a recently bought product and how satisfied they were
* Interaction effect between complexity, time thinking and satisfaction 
* __Need to learn to translate effect sizes back into original scale__
* __Question how accurate recollection is - don't want to admit spending 15 mins thinking about shampoo.__
* __More time conscious = less time subconscious is poor assumption at these time-scales - plenty of time for both.__

Experiment 4:

* Survey of people exiting IKEA (assumed complex) or Bijenkorf (assumed simple).
* Split at median (__why throw away scale?__) (__why use regression above but split here?__)
