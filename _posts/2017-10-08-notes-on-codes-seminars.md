## [On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect](https://www.dc.uba.ar/materias/incc/2015/c2/practicas/p1/The%20Deliberation-Without_Attention.pdf)

Unconscious Thought Theory

Theory is that conscious thought is sub-optimal for decisions with many aspects because it can only focus on a few things at a time.

Experiment 1:

* Simple car choice (4 aspects) vs complex car choice (12 aspects)
* Car 1 75% positive aspects, cars 2+3 50%, car 4 25%
* Conscious thought - think for 4 mins. Unconscious thought - distracted for 4 mins by anagrams.
* Conscious thinkers won in simple choice but lost in complex choice (where win = pick 75%)
* __Not blinded__
* __Assumption that 75% is the right choice - maybe the one good aspect is important. Are they subsets?__
* __Assumes students bring no outside knowledge in. Were there names or pictures?__

Experiment 2:

* Same, but asked for opinion instead and measured opinion diff

Experiment 3:

* Survey to ask what aspects people would take into consideration for 40 different products
* 49 students asked how much time the spent thinking about a recently bought product and how satisfied they were
* Interaction effect between complexity, time thinking and satisfaction 
* __Need to learn to translate effect sizes back into original scale__
* __Question how accurate recollection is - don't want to admit spending 15 mins thinking about shampoo.__
* __More time conscious = less time subconscious is poor assumption at these time-scales - plenty of time for both.__

Experiment 4:

* Survey of people exiting IKEA (assumed complex) or Bijenkorf (assumed simple).
* Split at median (__why throw away scale?__) (__why use regression above but split here?__)

## Seminar 1

Further comments:

* Conscious vs unconscious processing is poorly defined - they don't give enough detail to justify their interpretation of the experiment
  * eg did unconscious processing actually take place during distraction (later conceptual replication used snap judgments with same effect)
  * eg did distraction actually prevent unconscious processing
  * eg does unconscious processing also take place in non-distracted condition, alongside conscious processing
  * eg could the effect instead be explained by conscious processing in both cases, but performing poorer with more time
* No concrete mechanism proposed - what algorithm is unconscious processing using that makes it better
* Satisfaction is poorly defined
  * eg maybe people who think too much about a purchase have lower satisfaction because of the thinking, not because the choice was worse (consistent with choice regret)
* Lots of instances of p=.04, suspicious of p-hacking

General points:

* If effects are small, not robust and shed no further light on mental mechanism, just don't do the experiment. This is not a useful direction to pursue.
* Don't compare p-values - to test if one effect is significantly stronger than another you need to compare the effect sizes directly.
* Be wary of subjective scales, especially for between-subjects designs.
* Treat '...demonstrates...' and '...clearly shows...' as warning signs that the evidence is weak and the author is compensating (as opposed to '...suggests...' or '...supports...')
