> This course provides a thorough introduction to the General Linear Model, which incorporates analyses such as multiple regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, repeated-measures ANOVA. We will also cover extensions to linear mixed-effects models and logistic regression. All techniques will be discussed within a general framework of building and comparing statistical models. Practical experience in applying the methods will be developed through exercises with the statistics package SPSS. 

## [Lecture 1](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=11131)

Ignore cookbook approach, do model comparison.

General linear model.

Inference as attempted generalization from sample to population (__non-Bayesian?__).

Want estimators to be:

* Unbiased - expected value is true value
* Consistent - variance decreases as sample size increases
* Efficient - smallest variance out of all unbiased estimators

Efficient estimators:

* Count of errors -> mode
* Sum of absolute errors -> median
* Sum of squared errors -> mean

## [Lecture 2](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=11131&section=2)

Model is model of population (__which implies that we can include sampling method in inference if we think we can accurately model the bias__).

Proportional reduction in error $PRE = \frac{\operatorname{SSE}(C) - \operatorname{SSE}(A)}{\operatorname{SSE}(C)}$. On population is usually denoted $\eta^2$.

F-score for GLM: $F = \frac{\left(\frac{\mathrm{RSS}_1 - \mathrm{RSS}_2}{p_2 - p_1}\right)}{\left(\frac{\mathrm{RSS}_2}{n - p_2}\right)} \sim F(p_2 - p_1, n - p_2)$

F-test: reject null if $P_\mathrm{null}(F > F_\mathrm{observed}) < \alpha$. Fixes $P(\mathrm{Type1}) = \alpha$. Produces tradeoff curve between $P(\mathrm{Type2})$ and real effect size.

95% confidence interval of estimate = on 95% of samples, confidence interval falls around true population value = reject null if (1-$\alpha$) confidence interval does not contain null.
