## [Lecture 1](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=11131)

Ignore cookbook approach, do model comparison.

General linear model.

Inference as attempted generalization from sample to population (__non-Bayesian?__).

Want estimators to be:

* Unbiased - expected value is true value
* Consistent - variance decreases as sample size increases
* Efficient - smallest variance out of all unbiased estimators

Efficient estimators:

* Count of errors -> mode
* Sum of absolute errors -> median
* Sum of squared errors -> mean
