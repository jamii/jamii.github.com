Says $1/survey, ~10mins to complete

Attention checks. 

Diversity - probably doesn't matter if WEIRD

Give bonus per correct to incentivize trying. Make sure clicking randomly doesn't make experiment finish faster. Only one try. Randomize so can't share information.

Expect to see hump in the middle. 

Run until money amount? Or run until HPDI tight?

Test offline first.

Todo:

* Need a good q - want to get lots of data from each participant
* Figure out what effect size to expect
* Look up discounting results?
* Try mturk

Could use gradually increasing difficulty, wait to see if they twig
Do awareness cues at regular intervals, derange for coding

Best bet so far https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c28/2ebf7502c104deabab2c5f7563058839b6cc.pdf
