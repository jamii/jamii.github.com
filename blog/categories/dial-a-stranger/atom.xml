    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/jamii/dial-a-stranger">This spawnfest entry</a> is inspired by traveling. I love the idea behind sites like chatroulette and omegle but if I had an internet connection I wouldn&rsquo;t be bored enough to use them. I want a version I can use entirely over the phone network to while away the hours spent stuck in airports and train stations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built a quick proof of concept using twilio. Dial +1 (650) 763-8833 and you will be put on hold. As soon as there are two people on hold they will be linked together into a conference call.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a great solution, since you have to sit around and wait for the next person to arrive. Perhaps a better method would be to have users register by SMS and then make outbound calls to both users once a connection is ready.</p>

<p>I also hooked up a chat bot to the SMS api. Eliza is ready and waiting on +1 (650) 763-8782 to listen to your problems and ask vague questions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to go with this. I have a vague idea that it could be turned into a game but the details elude me.</p>
