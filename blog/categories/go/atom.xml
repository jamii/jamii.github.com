    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a little optimisation work <a href="https://github.com/jamii/hugo-a-go-go/">hugo</a> now manages to play out ~12k games per second on a 9x9 board. Besides fixing the two incorrect optimisations I made during the last minutes of the competition, the main wins were changing the board representation and carefully inspecting the compiler output to eliminate unneccesary work. A lot of the things I discovered are generally applicable to calculation-heavy, cpu-bound cljs code (with all the usual disclaimers about profiling and premature optimsation).</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>The board is now packed into a Uint8Array. With borders included, the board is an 11x11 grid.</p>

<p>``` clj
(def size 9)
(def array-size (+ 2 size))
(def max-pos (* array-size array-size))</p>

<p>(defn &ndash;>pos [x y]
  (+ 1 x (* array-size (+ 1 y))))
```</p>

<p>The first 121 entries in the array represent the colour of each cell on the board.</p>

<p>``` clj
(def empty 0)
(def black 1)
(def white 2)
(def grey 3) ;; for the border</p>

<p>(defmacro get-colour [board pos]
  `(aget ~board ~pos))</p>

<p>(defmacro set-colour [board pos colour]
  `(aset ~board ~pos ~colour))
```</p>

<p>The next 121 entries track which string is present on a cell. Strings are just represented by an integer id. The last entry in the array tracks the next id to be assigned.</p>

<p>``` clj
(def empty-string 0)
(def grey-string 1)</p>

<p>(defmacro new-string [board]
  `(let [next-string# (aget ~board 1023)]</p>

<pre><code> (aset ~board 1023 (+ next-string# 1))
 next-string#))
</code></pre>

<p>(defmacro get-string [board pos]
  `(aget ~board (+ ~max-pos ~pos)))</p>

<p>(defmacro set-string [board pos string]
  `(aset ~board (+ ~max-pos ~pos) ~string))
```</p>

<p>The next 121 entries track the number of non-empty neighbouring cells, which is useful for short-circuiting <code>suicide?</code> and <code>eyelike?</code> tests.</p>

<p><code>`` clj
(defmacro get-neighbours [board pos]
 </code>(let [freedom-ix# (+ ~(* 2 max-pos) ~pos)]</p>

<pre><code> (aget ~board freedom-ix#)))
</code></pre>

<p>(defmacro add-neighbours [board pos amount]
  `(let [freedom-ix# (+ ~(* 2 max-pos) ~pos)]</p>

<pre><code> (aset ~board freedom-ix# (+ (aget ~board freedom-ix#) ~amount))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally, the remaining cells map string ids to the number of pseudo-liberties belonging to that string.</p>

<p><code>`` clj
(defmacro get-liberties [board pos]
 </code>(let [string-ix# (+ ~(* 3 max-pos) (get-string ~board ~pos))]</p>

<pre><code> (aget ~board string-ix#)))
</code></pre>

<p>(defmacro add-liberties [board pos amount]
  `(let [string-ix# (+ ~(* 3 max-pos) (get-string ~board ~pos))]</p>

<pre><code> (aset ~board string-ix# (+ (aget ~board string-ix#) ~amount))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Packing the board this way gives two benefits. First, every field access is reduced to a few instructions. This isn&rsquo;t as big a win as one might think, given that the structure of the old layout was predictable enough for the jit to replace hash lookups with struct access. More importantly, packing the board means that creating a copy is a single array copy. Cheap copying means we can cache boards all over the place and this leads to a lot of saved work in the UCT stage.</p>

<p>My implementation here is a little clumsy but in the future a cljs port of <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/vertigo">vertigo</a> would make this a lot cleaner. This is the kind of abstraction that would be difficult to implement in plain js.</p>

<h2>Truth</h2>

<p>In cljs, only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are falsey. In generated code, if the cljs compiler cannot infer that the test in a branch is a boolean, it wraps it in <code>cljs.core.truth_</code> to test for cljs truthiness rather than js truthiness.</p>

<p>``` clj
(defn foo? [x]
  (= &ldquo;foo&rdquo; x))</p>

<p>(defn unfoo [x]
  (if (foo? x)</p>

<pre><code>nil
x))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>js
hugo_a_go_go.board.foo_QMARK_ = function(a) {
  return cljs.core._EQ_.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2("foo", a)
};
hugo_a_go_go.board.unfoo = function(a) {
  return cljs.core.truth_(hugo_a_go_go.board.foo_QMARK_(a)) ? null : a
};
</code></p>

<p>Normally this doesn&rsquo;t matter but hugo is optimised enough already that profiling showed it spending ~15% of it&rsquo;s time inside <code>cljs.core.truth_</code>. You can avoid it either by adding type hints&hellip;</p>

<p>``` clj
(defn ^boolean foo? [x]
  (= &ldquo;foo&rdquo; x))</p>

<p>(defn unfoo [x]
  (if (foo? x)</p>

<pre><code>nil
x))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>js
hugo_a_go_go.board.foo_QMARK_ = function(a) {
  return cljs.core._EQ_.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2("foo", a)
};
hugo_a_go_go.board.unfoo = function(a) {
  return hugo_a_go_go.board.foo_QMARK_(a) ? null : a
};
</code></p>

<p>&hellip; or by wrapping the test in a function that is already hinted.</p>

<p>``` clj
(defn foo? [x]
  (= &ldquo;foo&rdquo; x))</p>

<p>(defn unfoo [x]
  (if (true? (foo? x))</p>

<pre><code>nil
x))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>js
hugo_a_go_go.board.foo_QMARK_ = function(a) {
  return cljs.core._EQ_.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2("foo", a)
};
hugo_a_go_go.board.unfoo = function(a) {
  return!0 === hugo_a_go_go.board.foo_QMARK_(a) ? null : a
};
</code></p>

<h2>Equality</h2>

<p>Clojure defaults to structural equality where possible, rather than using javascript&rsquo;s insane notion of equality.</p>

<p><code>clj
(defn opposite-colour [colour]
  (if (= colour black) white black))
</code></p>

<p><code>js
hugo_a_go_go.board.opposite_colour = function(a) {
  return cljs.core._EQ_.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2(a, hugo_a_go_go.board.black) ? hugo_a_go_go.board.white : hugo_a_go_go.board.black
};
</code></p>

<p>Again, this is something that normally doesn&rsquo;t matter but hugo was spending ~20% of cpu time in <code>cljs.core.__EQ__</code>. Since we know we are comparing integers we can use <code>==</code> instead, which compiles down to <code>===</code> in js.</p>

<p><code>clj
(defn opposite-colour [colour]
  (if (== colour black) white black))
</code></p>

<p><code>js
hugo_a_go_go.board.opposite_colour = function(a) {
  return a === hugo_a_go_go.board.black ? hugo_a_go_go.board.white : hugo_a_go_go.board.black
};
</code></p>

<p>For other primitive types it seems that <code>identical?</code> will inline to <code>===</code>. For keywords you now have to use <code>keyword-identical?</code> which unfortunately does not inline.</p>

<h2>Polyadic calls</h2>

<p>Clojure functions can dispatch on the number of arguments. Usually the cljs compiler does a good job of compiling away the extra indirection, but it struggles with local functions.</p>

<p>``` clj
(defn foo []
  (letfn [(bar [x y] (= x y))]</p>

<pre><code>(bar :foo :bar)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>``` js
hugo_a_go_go.board.foo = function() {
  var a = function(a, c) {</p>

<pre><code>return cljs.core._EQ_.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2(a, c)
</code></pre>

<p>  };
  return a.cljs$core$IFn$<em>invoke$arity$2 ? a.cljs$core$IFn$</em>invoke$arity$2(new cljs.core.Keyword(null, &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, 1014005816), new cljs.core.Keyword(null, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, 1014001541)) : a.call(null, new cljs.core.Keyword(null, &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, 1014005816), new cljs.core.Keyword(null, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, 1014001541))
};
```</p>

<p>The important part to notice here is that it tests if <code>a.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2</code> exists before calling it, despite the fact that that is statically known. We had some small (~5%) performance improvements in a few places (notably board/flood-fill) by lifting all closures up to top-level functions so that the compiler can remove that check.</p>

<h2>Mutable variables</h2>

<p>Sometimes you need a mutable variable. Using atoms incurs overhead for eg checking watches. According to <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/06/10/porting-notchs-minecraft-demo-to-clojurescript/">David Nolen</a>, the best option in cljs is creating a one-element array.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have safe access to mutable vars in the style of <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/proteus">proteus</a> instead.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>While it meet seem annoying to have to work around the compiler sometimes to get decent performance, I far prefer to have sane semantics by default and just remember a few simple tricks for speeding up inner loops. Having access to macros also opens the door to a world of performant abstractions that would be extremely painful in plain js (eg <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">core.match</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/vertigo">vertigo</a>). Now that the core of hugo is just bashing on integers and byte arrays there is also the potential to compile sections of it to <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> for even more performance.</p>

<p>Hugo now plays fairly sensibly but is still easy to defeat even for a novice player like me. I suspect that the UCT stage is still not entirely correct so the next step is to build a visualiser for the game tree so I can see the reasoning behind it&rsquo;s moves.</p>

    <id>http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2013/10/06/hugo-a-go-go</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the <a href="http://clojurecup.com/">2013 Clojure Cup</a> myself and <a href="http://www.thattommyhall.com/">Tom Hall</a> wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29">go</a> AI in clojurescript, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/pushkin">pushkin</a>. The source is <a href="https://github.com/jamii/hugo-a-go-go/">here</a> and it can currently be played on the <a href="http://hugoagogo.clojurecup.com/">clojure cup site</a> (only tested in chrome).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Before reading this post it would help to understand the rules of go. Hugo-a-go-go follows (an approximation of) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Go#Chinese_rules">chinese rules</a>. Due to the limited time we don&rsquo;t yet check for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Go#Ko">ko</a> and don&rsquo;t even attempt to detect the end of the game. The code at the moment is incredibly messy and probably very buggy (the version we submitted seems to actually <em>try</em> to lose) so treat it with suspicion.</p>

<h2>Board</h2>

<p>The best place to start is with the board representation. The most expensive operation for the AI is detecting suicide and death. To make this fast we track connected strings of pieces.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defrecord String [colour liberties])
</code></p>

<p><code>colour</code> is one of <code>:black</code>, <code>:white</code>, <code>:grey</code> (for the border) or <code>:empty</code>. <code>liberties</code> tracks the number of <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/computer-go-archive/hs259RQQ5hI/TOLFX2d5Y6UJ">pseudo-liberties</a> the string has (for black or white strings; for empty or grey strings the <code>liberties</code> value is never read and exists just to avoid having to branch on the colour).</p>

<p>The board is represented by a 1d array of pointers to strings (this representation is inspired by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/">gnugo</a> rather than pushkin) and a pointer to the empty string (which we use for fast <code>empty?</code> checks).</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defrecord Board [strings empty-string])</p>

<p>(def size 9)
(def array-size (+ 2 size))
(def max-pos (* array-size array-size))</p>

<p>(defn &ndash;>pos [x y]
  (+ 1 x (* array-size (+ 1 y))))
```</p>

<p>To create a board we just have to setup the empty-string and border-string.</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn new []
  (let [empty-string (&ndash;>String :empty 0)</p>

<pre><code>    border-string (-&gt;String :grey 0)
    strings (object-array max-pos)]
(dotimes [i max-pos]
  (aset strings i empty-string))
(dotimes [i array-size]
  (aset strings (-&gt;pos (dec i) -1) border-string)
  (aset strings (-&gt;pos (dec i) size) border-string)
  (aset strings (-&gt;pos -1 (dec i)) border-string)
  (aset strings (-&gt;pos size (dec i)) border-string))
(-&gt;Board strings empty-string)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>A given move is <em>not</em> suicide if, after the move is made, there is at least one neighbour which is either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the same colour and has more than zero liberties</p></li>
<li><p>the opposite colour and has zero liberties (ie would die if the move was carried through)</p></li>
<li><p>empty</p></li>
</ul>


<p>``` clojure
(defn suicide? [^Board board colour pos]
  (let [suicide (atom true)</p>

<pre><code>    opposite-colour (condp keyword-identical? colour :black :white :white :black)]
;; decrement all the neighbours liberties
(foreach-neighbour neighbour-pos pos
  (let [string (aget (.-strings board) neighbour-pos)]
    (set! (.-liberties string) (dec (.-liberties string)))))
;; check for suicide
(foreach-neighbour neighbour-pos pos
  (let [string (aget (.-strings board) neighbour-pos)]
    (condp keyword-identical? (.-colour string)
      colour (when (&gt; (.-liberties string) 0)
               (reset! suicide false))
      opposite-colour (when (= (.-liberties string) 0)
                        (reset! suicide false))
      :empty (reset! suicide false)
      :grey nil)))
;; undo the decrement
(foreach-neighbour neighbour-pos pos
  (let [string (aget (.-strings board) neighbour-pos)]
    (set! (.-liberties string) (inc (.-liberties string)))))
@suicide))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Actually making a move is similar but we have to clear out dead strings and join adjacent strings together. Proving that it&rsquo;s safe to do all this in a single pass is straightforward, if tedious.</p>

<p>``` clojure
defn set-colour [^Board board pos colour]
  (let [string (&ndash;>String colour 0)]</p>

<pre><code>(aset (.-strings board) pos string)
(foreach-neighbour neighbour-pos pos
                   (let [neighbour-string (aget (.-strings board) neighbour-pos)
                         neighbour-colour (.-colour neighbour-string)]
                     (condp keyword-identical? neighbour-colour
                       :empty
                       (set! (.-liberties (aget (.-strings board) pos)) (inc (.-liberties (aget (.-strings board) pos))))

                       :grey
                       nil

                       colour
                       (do
                         (set! (.-liberties neighbour-string) (dec (.-liberties neighbour-string)))
                         (join-strings board (aget (.-strings board) pos) neighbour-string pos neighbour-pos))

                       ;; opposite colour
                       (do
                         (set! (.-liberties neighbour-string) (dec (.-liberties neighbour-string)))
                         (when (= 0 (.-liberties neighbour-string))
                           (clear-string board neighbour-string neighbour-pos))))))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Monte Carlo</h2>

<p>Go branches far too much to exhaustively check all possible futures. Instead we use a heuristic measure of the value of a move &ndash; the Monte Carlo estimate of the expected score when both players choose from the set of valid moves uniformly at random. To put it simply, we run large numbers of random games from this board position and take the mean score as our measure of how strong this board position is. Since we don&rsquo;t have a test for the end of the game we just run until either 100 moves have been made or until both sides have no valid moves remaining.</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn flood-fill [board colour]
  (let [filled (object-array max-pos)]</p>

<pre><code>(letfn [(flood-fill-around [pos]
          (foreach-neighbour pos pos
              (when (and (not (aget filled pos))
                         (keyword-identical? :empty (get-colour board pos)))
                (aset filled pos true)
                (flood-fill-around pos))))]
  (dotimes [x size]
    (dotimes [y size]
      (let [pos (-&gt;pos x y)]
        (when (keyword-identical? colour (get-colour board pos))
          (aset filled pos true)
          (flood-fill-around pos))))))
(count (filter identity filled))))
</code></pre>

<p>(defn score [board]
  (let [white-flood (flood-fill board :white)</p>

<pre><code>    black-flood (flood-fill board :black)
    total (* size size)
    overlap (- (+ white-flood black-flood) total)
    white-score (- white-flood overlap)
    black-score (- black-flood overlap)]
{:white white-score :black black-score}))
</code></pre>

<p>(defn random-move [board colour]
  (let [starting-pos (random-int board/max-pos)]</p>

<pre><code>(loop [pos starting-pos]
  (if (and (board/valid? board colour pos)
           (not (board/eyelike? board colour pos)))
    pos
    (let [new-pos (mod (inc pos) board/max-pos)]
      (if (= starting-pos new-pos)
        nil
        (recur new-pos)))))))
</code></pre>

<p>(defn with-random-moves [board n starting-colour]
  (doseq [colour (take n (interleave (repeat starting-colour) (repeat (board/opposite-colour starting-colour))))]</p>

<pre><code>  (when-let [move (random-move board colour)]
    (board/set-colour board move colour)))
</code></pre>

<p>  board)
```</p>

<p>You may notice that the above code actually only runs until one side has no moves &ndash; this is the first of many bugs.</p>

<p>The scoring and random-move code was a huge bottleneck so at the last minute I &lsquo;optimised&rsquo; it by changing it to:</p>

<p>``` clojure
;; rough approximation of the final score if the board is tightly packed
(defn score [board colour]
  (let [score (atom 0)]</p>

<pre><code>(dotimes [pos board/max-pos]
  (when (keyword-identical? colour (board/get-colour board pos))
    (swap! score inc)))
@score))
</code></pre>

<p>;; massive speedup at the expense of never playing in killed spaces
(defn with-random-moves-from [board n starting-colour moves]
  (js/goog.array.shuffle moves)
  (loop [colour starting-colour]</p>

<pre><code>(if-let [move (.pop moves)]
  (board/set-colour board move colour)
  (recur (board/opposite-colour colour))))
</code></pre>

<p>  board)
```</p>

<p>I think it is these two changes that are largely responsible for the submitted version playing so poorly &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t check for eyes in the random playouts, doesn&rsquo;t allow the other player to keep killing strings when the ai player has no moves and doesn&rsquo;t count eyes in the final score. This explains why it likes to tightly pack pieces against the edge of the board.</p>

<h2>UCT</h2>

<p>While the monte-carlo estimate gives us a reasonable heuristic for move strength it doesn&rsquo;t re-use any information between passes. With such a large move space we need to explore more intelligently. The <a href="http://teytaud.over-blog.com/article-35709049.html">UCT</a> algorithm treats move-selection like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit problem</a>.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://scattered-thoughts.net//www.youtube.com/embed/dbvoPg51CqQ?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">video</iframe>


<p>We build a tree of moves where each node in the tree tracks not just the estimated score for all its child nodes but also the upper bound of a confidence interval on that estimate.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defrecord Node [parent colour pos count sum nodes valids])
</code></p>

<p><code>colour</code> is the colour making the move at this node. <code>pos</code> is the position at which it is moving. <code>nodes</code> is a list of child nodes for which we have estimates. <code>valids</code> is a list of valid moves which have not yet been converted into nodes. <code>count</code> and <code>sum</code> track the mean score for all the children in <code>nodes</code>.</p>

<p>On each iteration we pick a path through the tree, choosing some explore/exploit tradeoff using the upper confidence bounds. Given the limited time we had, I decided to just copy a scoring function from a paper without stopping to understand it, so I don&rsquo;t actually know what explore/exploit tradeoff we are making :S</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn best-child [node]
  (let [best-score (atom (&ndash; (/ 1 0)))</p>

<pre><code>    best-child (atom nil)]
(doseq [child (.-nodes node)]
  (let [score (+ (/ (.-sum child) (.-count child))
                 (js/Math.sqrt
                  (/ (* 2 (js/Math.log (.-count node)))
                     (* 5 (.-count child)))))]
    (when (&gt; score @best-score)
      (reset! best-score score)
      (reset! best-child child))))
@best-child))
</code></pre>

<p>(defn expand [board node ai-colour]
  (let [pos (.-pos node)]</p>

<pre><code>(if (not= 0 pos) ;; top node has pos 0 - probably a smell
  (board/set-colour board pos (.-colour node))))
</code></pre>

<p>  (if-let [valid-pos (.pop (.-valids node))]</p>

<pre><code>(.push (.-nodes node) (expand-leaf board ai-colour node (board/opposite-colour (.-colour node)) valid-pos))
(if-let [child (if (= (.-colour node) ai-colour)
                 (worst-child node)
                 (best-child node))]
  (expand board child ai-colour)
  nil ;; no possible moves - pass
  )))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>On reaching a leaf we extend it by one more move, estimate the value of that move using monte-carlo simulations and then propagate the value back up the path to the top of tree.</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn expand-leaf [board ai-colour parent colour pos]
  (board/set-colour board pos colour)
  (let [valids (valids board (board/opposite-colour colour))]</p>

<pre><code>(random/with-random-moves-from board 100 (board/opposite-colour colour) (aclone valids))
(let [value (value board ai-colour)]
  (add-value parent value)
  (-&gt;Node parent colour pos 1 value (object-array 0) valids))))
</code></pre>

<p>(defn add-value [node value]
  (set! (.-count node) (+ (.-count node) 1))
  (set! (.-sum node) (+ (.-sum node) value))
  (if-let [parent (.-parent node)]</p>

<pre><code>(recur parent value)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally, the ai chooses its move by running a number of iterations of this algorithm and returning the value of <code>best-child</code> at the root (this is probably wrong &ndash; at this point we should just exploit, not explore).</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn move-for [board colour n]
  (let [node (hugo-a-go-go.tree/new (board/copy board) colour)]</p>

<pre><code>(dotimes [_ n]
  (expand (board/copy board) node colour))
(when-let [child (best-child node)]
  (.-pos child))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Postmortem</h2>

<p>Together we spent around 20 man-hours on the competition. I spent the first two thirds of the competition just getting the board representation to work correctly. Part of the delay was that after moving to a cljs-only implementation the feedback loop was much slower. I wasted an hour or two tring to get brepl working without any success and after that had to rely on print statements and pre-compiled test cases. Finding errors in cljs also leaves a lot to be desired (eg a typo in a field name resulted in an <code>undefined</code> value which, several functions later, became a <code>NaN</code> which then behaves interestingly inside max/min). I only started on the UCT code an hour or two before the deadline. Tom started on the user input around the same time. We played our first game against the ai about five minutes before the deadline and frantically submitted whatever code we had running.</p>

<p>If we were taking it more seriously we certainly could have done a lot more to prepare &ndash; being familiar with the cljs dev tools, actually learning the rules of go, sketching out the board representation and the UCT implementation before the weekend started, not walking a marathon on the same weekend. But winning was not the goal and instead we had a lot of fun and excitement seeing just how much we can hack together in such a short space of time.</p>

<p>Our AI is definitely not correct so it&rsquo;s difficult to evaluate the project yet. The code is relatively short and simple (especially compared to eg <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnugo.git/tree/engine">gnugo</a>) but that doesn&rsquo;t mean much until it actually works. The performance is promising &ndash; the current version can simulate around 5k games per second in chrome. Fixing the monte-carlo step and the scoring will eat into that performance but I&rsquo;ve already spotted plenty of inefficiencies in other places. We haven&rsquo;t even started experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/vertigo">vertigo</a> or <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> yet so there is certainly lots of headroom.</p>

<p>I am definitely hoping to come back to this project. To echo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5dYE0CMmHQ">Zach Tellman&rsquo;s motivation</a>, it will be really interesting to see if it is possible to write a competitive go AI in a high-level language. We&rsquo;ve also thought about distributing the UCT step and have team games pitching the aggregated wisdom of a group of human players voting on their next move against the assembled computing power of their browsing machines.</p>
