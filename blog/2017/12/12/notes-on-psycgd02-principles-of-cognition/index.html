module outlines general theoretical principles that underlie cognitive processes across many domains, ranging from perception to language, to reasoning and decision making. The focus will be on general, quantitative regularities, and the degree to which theories focusing on specific cognitive scientific topics can be constrained by such principles. There will be an introduction on general methods and approaches in cognitive science and some of the problems related to them. Later in the course, some computational approaches in cognitive science will be discussed. There will be particular emphasis on understanding cognitive principles that are relevant to theories of decision making.</blockquote><h2 id="what-is-cognitive-science"><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.645.8834&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">What is Cognitive Science?</a></h2><p>Brief history.<p>Notable that the narrative revolves around several key conferences where prominent figures from different fields became aligned.<h2 id="bridging-levels-of-analysis-for-probabilistic-models-of-cognition"><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.704.2311&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Bridging Levels of Analysis for Probabilistic Models of Cognition</a></h2><p>Levels of models:<ul><li>Computational - problem and declarative solution eg Bayesian inference<li>Algorithmic - representation and constructive solution eg message passing<li>Implementation - physical processes eg neurons</ul><p>Popular research method is to look at where people diverge from ideal solutions, to figure out what algorithms their mind is using to approximate the solution.

Complexity term in 1st formulation penalizes more complex models - regularization/shrinking.<blockquote><p>The fact that these models predict empirically observed receptive fields so well suggests that we are endowed with (or acquire) prior expectations that the causes of our sensations are largely independent and sparse.</blockquote><p>Arranged hierarchically, so each model passes prediction error up and passes predictions down. Precision parameter models noise at each level. High noise =&gt; more trust in priors / predictions from above. Low noise =&gt; more trust in sensory data from below.<p>States ‘value is inverse proportional to surprise’. (In a particular simple model) if we perform gradient ascent on value, then the long-term proportion of time spent in a state is proportional to value, so surprise is inversely proportional to value. Since we act to minimize free energy, priors can encode values. <strong>But does acting to minimize free energy lead to gradient ascent on value?
