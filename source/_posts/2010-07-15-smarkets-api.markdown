Since the beginning of June I have been working at [smarkets](http://smarkets.com). Smarkets is a betting exchange, something like a cross between a traditional bookies and a stock exchange. You can buy and sell contracts like 'England will lose the world cup' whose value is determined by events in the real world. Trading continues right up until the contracts are settled so you can watch the market prices change in real time during a live event.

One of my main responsibilities is the public api, which has just been released after the best part of a month of work. This first release contains enough functionality to create your own interface to the smarkets backend or to run automated trading robots. Documentation will soon be available on the main site - for now it is living [here](http://smarkets.com/api/documentation/) until the sphinx default stylesheets have been replaced with smarkety goodness. You will, of course, need a smarkets account to get started.

Have fun, play nice.
