Suppose I want to track how I spend my day. There are plenty of existing time-tracking apps, but none of them were invented here.

I could build an app from scratch. I would just need to write code for displaying entries, adding new entries, editing old entries, summarizing data, storing data, tracking changes...

Or I could just dump it in a spreadsheet, add a few formulas and call it a day. 

This is the real magic of spreadsheets - there is a large class of problems where just pasting the data into an editable grid provides 90% of the necessary interactions, and adding a few formulae and charts handles the remaining 10%. 

And having noticed that, you have to also wonder if there are other classes of problems where a similar 90%-done UI paradigm might exist. 

As it turns out, putting my time-tracker in a spreadsheet doesn't quite solve the problem, because the biggest problem I have with time-trackers is that I forget to use them. I want a time-tracker that can pop up a notification to ask me if I've really been writing a blog post for 27 hours or if I just forgot to check out.

The same goes for todo lists, [experience samplers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method), lab journals, quantified-self shenanigans etc. They all need to record when things happen and prompt actions from the user at specific times. 

Which is all a leadup for presenting [Monolog](https://github.com/jamii/monolog): a semi-successful experiment in making a 90%-done UI for journal-like problems. 

The core data model is a log of timestamped plain-text entries.

The entries and the timestamp are both editable.

Snippets of code can annotate entries with arbitrary html.

``` cljs

(when (= :todo (@todos (:ix message)))
  [:button {:style {:margin "0px 5px 0px 5px"
                    :padding "0px 10px 0px 10px"}
            :on-click #(log! {:contents (.replace (:contents message) "#todo" "#task")})}
   "↻"])
(when (= :todo (@todos (:ix message)))
  [:button {:style {:margin "0px 5px 0px 5px"
                    :padding "0px 10px 0px 10px"}
          :on-click #(log! {:contents (str "#done #" (:ix message))})}
   "✓"])
```

Clicking on the tick button marks the todo as done.

Clicking on the refresh button turns the todo into a current task.

Other code snippets can annotate the entries with interpretations of their contents, such as parsing durations and times.

``` cljs
(doseq [message messages
        :when (nil? (@natty message))]
  (xhrio/send "/natty"
              #(swap! natty assoc message (read-string (-> % .-target .getResponseText)))
              "POST"
              (pr-str {:message message})
              (structs/Map. #js {:Content-Type "application/edn"})))
```

And another snippet uses the estimated durations of tasks to decide when to nudge the user about overrunning.

``` cljs
(when-let [last-task (first (for [task (reverse @tasks)
                                  :when task]
                              task))]
  (when (> (:duration last-task) (:estimate last-task))
    [nudge-ui (str "Your last " (-> last-task :kind name) " is at " (:duration last-task) " / " (:estimate last-task) " mins! What are you up to?") "#task "]))
```

The nudge can be cleared by adding a new task or break.

Nudges also work for experience sampling. Clicking on this experience sampling nudge partially fills out a new log entry.

``` cljs
(let [last-sample (first (for [sample (reverse @samples)
                               :when sample]
                           sample))]
  (when (or (nil? last-sample) (> @now (:next-sample last-sample)))
    [nudge-ui (str "It's sampling time!") (str "#sample  (next sample " (time->string (js/Date. (+ (.getTime @now) (* (js/Math.random) 1000 60 60 8)))) ")")
```

Finally, filters can produce task-specific views of the log, like uncompleted todos or chargeable hours.

``` cljs
(def filters
  {:all #(do true)
   :todo #(= :todo (@todos (:ix %)))
   :projectx #(contains (:contents %) "#projectx")})
```

``` cljs
(when (= :projectx @current-filter)
  [:div {:style {:font-weight "bold"
                  :text-align "center"
                  :flex 1}}
   (format "%.0f hours - £%.2f" (/ @projectx-minutes 60) (* (/ @projectx-minutes 60 6) 400))])
```

That's ~200 loc for the base functionality plus ~200 loc for a time tracker, todo list, experience sampler and even a little repl. Since the only mutable state is the log and that is only mutated by direct user actions, I can safely use [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) to live-update the app whenever I hit save in the code. Adding new apps usually only takes a couple of minutes from idea to live implementation.

To be really useful though it needs to be a mobile app, and I never got around to figuring out to get the same live-coding experience that I get as a locally-served figwheel app. If I have to plug my phone in and run some build and deploy step it defeats a lot of the quick-and-hacky magic that I was aiming for. I'm sure it's doable though - maybe someone can suggest a nice approach?

Anyway, I posted this mainly to illustrate this idea of a 90%-done UI and hopefully to prompt people to look at other classes of problems that might have good solutions. [SIEUFERD](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ebakke/sieuferd/index.html) is trying to do this for CRUD apps. [Camlistore](https://camlistore.org/) and co seem to want to do the same for unstructured data, but they don't provide much in the way of interaction. What else is out there?
