Software developer and consultant. I find simple solutions to hard problems.

I focus on systems engineering and infrastructure. I have a strong background in mathematics and computer science.

I'm interested in the use of staged compilation, domain-specific languages and data-centric programming to reduce incidental complexity in software, especially distributed systems and p2p networks.
