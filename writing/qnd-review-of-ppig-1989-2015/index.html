<h1>Quick and dirty review of Psychology of Programming Interest Group 1989-2015</h1>

<article>
  <p>Inspired by Ji Yi's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yijisoo/qndreview-read-100-chi-papers-in-7-hours">homework assignment</a>, I decided to skim all 360-odd papers in the Psychology of Programming Interest Group <a href="http://www.ppig.org/library/paper">archives</a>.</p>
<p>Yi reports his students taking ~10 hours to skim 100 papers over a single weekend. His students are clearly way more disciplined than I am. I dragged it out for months. It was brutal.</p>
<p>Towards the end I did finally get up to about 50 papers a day, so if I do this again for other journals I'll probably just take a random sample of 50 papers and try to do the whole lot in one go.</p>
<p>What did I learn?</p>
<p>Not a great deal about the psychology of programming itself. For the most part the field doesn't feel like a stumbling progression towards enlightenment, but just plain stumbling.</p>
<p>Here are some common failure modes that frustrated me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plain bad science, especially in the early years where a lot of the experiments are 'my pet project vs the world' and somehow the pet project always comes out looking good. My favorite example has a graph where <a href="/img/control.png">the control group are clearly performing better</a>, and the author explains this away, saying it's because the control group were cheating, and in the conclusion of the paper declares the treatment a success. And it was published!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failing to validate instruments. In particular, a lot of papers that involve coding qualitative data didn't bother to have two people code the data independently to check for agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'We have to do some science, and this is science'. Many of the experiments are from the start clearly incapable of answering the original question. I realize that getting good data for these subjects is hard, but the opportunity cost still stings. Do a different experiment!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theoryless science. For example, one paper had programmers read programs under an eye-tracker and found there was a significant difference in the gaze patterns between the more experienced group and the less experienced group. So what? There's no suggestions as to what it means or how it can be used or under what conditions it's expected to be replicable. These papers typically end with &quot;further research is required&quot; and then no further research materializes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is often detectable right at the beginning. If I read the description of the experiment and I can't even make up an interesting result, that's not a good sign.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of papers that read like &quot;I found this in a book, we should apply it to programming&quot;. I don't know if it's fair to call that a failure mode, but I rarely found anything enlightening in these and most of them were not followed up with papers where they actually apply the idea.</p>
<p>On the positive side:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are a ton of negative results. PPIG seems to be totally willing to publish failed experiments, which is awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Things get better over time. Somewhere around the mid-2010s I started finding papers that actually seemed like results. The series of papers on testing whether students form consistent models is a particular highlight - it starts with an interesting correlation, then some failed replications, then refinements of the test, then some successful replications, then more refinements, then combining it with interviews to test validity. It's not sexy, but it does seem to be actual progress towards a reliable measure of one specific leak in the education pipeline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sort of vague idea that most of this work is just attacking things at too high a level. Programming is a big, diverse, complex skill and we don't really understand really basic subskills yet, or even know how to break it down into subskills. Without that it's impossible to know whether it makes sense to extrapolate any one set of results. If barely trained students benefit from syntax highlighting, does that mean professional programmers will? Or programmers in other languages? Or programmers dealing with programs longer than 50 lines? We have no idea.</p>
<p>Much of this reminds me of <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">Feynman's stories about rat experiments</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...his papers are not referred to, because he didn’t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the things we have to discover before we can discover things about programming? I have no idea.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the full notes. They're highly opinionated and I made no attempt to be fair to the authors. If I said something mean about your research, don't worry - I barely read it anyway :)</p>

<p>Two year programming class. 100 engineers. Errors in semicolon use concentrated on specific contexts, even though students have learned explicit syntax rules. Later errors become uniformly distributed ie attention lapses rather than misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Students don't learn syntax from specification of syntax - need contextualized experience. Parallel to natural language learning.</p>

<p>2nd and 3rd year students. 51 returned questionnaire and some were interviewed? Focused on four courses that use formal methods.</p>
<p>Students struggle to manipulate formal expressions by hand. Need automated tools. Only realized relevance of early course much later, when it was too late. Don't believe that formal methods are used 'in the real world'.</p>

<p>Do expert programmers develop better working memory, or do they learn to use external memory more effectively? Notice that experts jump around more often, while beginners tend towards linear program generation.</p>
<p>10 professionals. 12 2nd year undergrads.</p>
<p>Experiment 1. Have to program while speaking strings of digits - strains working memory. Expert performance did not suffer. Novices have more errors under suppression, and jump around code more often.</p>
<p>Experiment 2. Write a program using a program that doesn't allow lines to be edited after hitting enter. Experts produce more errors than novices in this environment.</p>
<p>Suggests that experts don't develop more working memory, but instead switch to strategies that use external memory more.</p>

<p>Biz students given spreadsheet tasks. Text and number entry was faster in google sheets, eyeballed at about 2/3 mean time. Formula entry faster in Excel.</p>
<p>Kind of a pointless comparison.</p>

<p>Proposed PhD project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2014-PPIG-25th-Church.pdf">A case of computational thinking: The subtle effect of hidden dependencies on the user experience of version control</a></p>
<p>Interviews with devs at Google and Autodesk on their use of VCS. Common themes: high understanding of concepts, ritualized interaction staying with narrow paths, signs of fear and uncertainty. (Slapping down the oft repeated assertion that git is only confusing if you don't understand the underlying model).</p>
<p>Speculates that dependencies on undisplayed state (eg staging area, current branch) and premature commitment (eg many operations are potentially destructive to the working tree) are the main culprits, which is why existing guis don't alleviate the problem.</p>

<p>Two online tutors. &gt;2000 students from 56 schools. Affective learning questionnaire - no significant interactions with gender, race or subject. Male students and caucasian/asian students scored better on pre-tests for arithmetic tutor. Non-CS students improved more between pre- and post-test.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2014-PPIG-25th-Teague-Lister.pdf">Blinded by their Plight: Tracing and the Preoperational Programmer</a></p>
<p>Ask students to trace code, and what the code is supposed to do. Identifies a group of students who can trace code and can't explain it. In talk-aloud, these students struggle to move from concrete value to abstract sets.</p>
<p>(Implies that laddering up is a additional skill on top of execution models.)</p>

<p>Programming environment that supports both direct manipulation, block editing and raw text editing.</p>

<p>10 subjects under eye-tracker. Mental execution task. Syntax highlighting reduces completion time. Stats are a bit suspect.</p>
<p>Notably, under syntax highlighting there are much fewer fixations on keywords. (Maybe colour enables peripheral vision?)</p>
