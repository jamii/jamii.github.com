<h1>Materialize Inc</h1>

<article>
  <p>I'm happy to report that I'm maintaining my commitment to viewing every problem as an incremental view maintenance problem by joining an <a href="https://materialize.io/">incremental view maintenance startup</a>.</p>
<p>Tradition dictates that I now convince the reader that You Too Can Join An Incremental View Maintenance Startup. So here are the some of the things that I found compelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience. Everyone involved so far has built similar systems in the past, so we can skip past all the obvious mistakes and make exciting new mistakes.</li>
<li>Sensible engineering. From the folks that brought you <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf">Scalability! But at what COST?</a> and <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-beta-passes-jepsen-testing/">Jepsen-approved serializability</a>.</li>
<li>Low hype. We're not Changing The Way The World Brushes Their Teeth. We're just trying to build a thing that works, in a field where <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses">most things don't work</a>.</li>
<li>People go home in the evening. Half of the company have families. There isn't any beer pong.</li>
<li>Open pay scale. Pinned to market levels (as determined by some incredibly expensive watermarked spreadsheet).</li>
<li>Explicit vacation guidelines. At numbers that won't make Europeans laugh in pity.</li>
<li>20% time with sane IP assignment.</li>
</ul>
