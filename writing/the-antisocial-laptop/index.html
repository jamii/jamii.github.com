<h1>The antisocial laptop</h1>

<article>
  <p>I've had this laptop for about three years and it's mostly served me well. It really only has one problem - it hates conference calls.</p>
<p>It doesn't mind the rest of the internet. I can watch videos, listen to music and play games with no problems. But as soon as I try to talk to a human being it's game over. The webcam can't be discovered, the connection drops, and if I don't get the hint it might just reboot itself.</p>
<p>It got away with it for a long time because the excuses were so plausible. The linux drivers for the webcam must be flaky. The wifi here is congested. The demo I was giving must have used up all my RAM and the OOM killer must have taken out something important.</p>
<p>But recently I backed it into a corner and things started getting serious. I ran an ethernet cable through my house and dug up the ethernet-usb adapter that shipped with my laptop. No more excuses.</p>
<p>The laptop responded by not only disconnecting the call I was on, but disconnecting the ethernet. On the next reboot, the monitor stopped updating. On the next, it not only disconnected the ethernet but claimed I no longer had a wifi interface either.</p>
<p>I found I could pretty reliably cause all three problems at any time by connecting the ethernet cable. But only during conference calls - I spent an entire day working and listening to music via the ethernet without a single laptop tantrum.</p>
<p>I finally figured out what was going on almost by accident. I suspected that the dell ethernet-usb adapter might be the source of the recent problems, and while searching for those keywords I stumbled across a <a href="https://plugable.com/2016/06/30/investigating-usb-c-problems-on-some-dell-xps-and-precision-laptops/">post from the manufacturers of a usb docking station</a> about customers with similar symptoms that only manifest on this particular laptop. Dell responded with a firmware update that reduced the wifi output power.</p>
<p>It turns out that the usb, hdmi and wifi are all sitting on top of each other and are not sufficiently well shielded. Some experimenting at home confirmed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>plugging in my usb webcam increases the number of dropped packets on the wifi</li>
<li>plugging in the ethernet only causes screen freezes when using an external hdmi monitor</li>
<li>the ethernet, monitor and webcam play fine together if the wifi is disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>I find it fascinating that for years I've had all the information necessary to debug this, but my mental model of causality was limited to the design of the machine - software interfaces and physical connections - and was completely missing the possibility of non-intentional interactions via the physical world. I suspect someone with an EE background would have immediately realized what was going on.</p>
