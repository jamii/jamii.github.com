## CTO at Eve

#### Nov 2013 - Jan 2016

* Together with the CEO built a prototype language/IDE which secured a $2.3m seed round from Andreessen Horowitz.

* Designed a live relational language based on temporal-logic extensions of datalog.

* Built relational databases, query planners and bootstrapped compilers for a series of prototypes (demonstrated in https://youtu.be/VZQoAKJPbh8).

* Read >200 papers on databases, logic languages, query planners, incremental view maintenance, query provenance, spatial indexes to discover how to build a practical relational database without tens of man-years of effort.

* Wrote the company blog, which saw ~100k views/year.

* Spoke at the MIT Media Lab.

* Invited as a resident at the Recurse Center.

* Helped release Light Table as an open-source project.

## Consultant

#### May 2009 – Nov 2013

Highlighted projects:

* Provided item-item article recommendations for Springer users based on ~600m past downloads. Uses locality-sensitive hashing and external sorting to run on a single low-powered server.

* Built a prototype replacement for the core trading engine at the Smarkets betting exchange: 10x less code, 40x better throughput, 10x better 99% latency.

* Built a LaTeX aware search engine to power latexsearch.com. Covers the entire Springer library - more than 8m LaTeX equations. Searches by tree-edit distance on compressed syntax trees, using suffix arrays as a first-pass filter.

## Student at Recurse Center

#### Oct 2012 – Dec 2012

* Built strucjure: a clojure DSL for pattern matching and parsing using PEGs.

* Built concerto: a multi-user clojure REPL aimed at collaborative live-coding.

* Extended the core.logic CLP solver with fair conjunction and a parallel solver.

* Began droplet: a clojure DSL for specifying distributed systems, based on the Bloom language.

## Intern at Jane Street Capital

#### Jun 2012 – Aug 2012

* Developed classification algorithms for a large financial dataset.

* Developed a denotational semantics and accompanying tests for a distributed message queue.

* Built trading bots for competitions on a mock exchange.

## MSc Computer Science at Oxford University

#### Oct 2008 – Sep 2010

* Studied randomized algorithms, probabilistic model checking, logics of multi-agent information flow, machine learning and intelligent systems.

* Dissertation: Design and analysis of a gossip overlay.

## BA Mathematics at University of Cambridge

#### Oct 2005 – July 2008

* Specialized in real analysis, discrete maths, probability and stochastic systems.
