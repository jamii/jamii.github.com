## Independent Researcher

#### Aug 2016 - today

* Built a relational query compiler that compiles queries into zero-allocation, [worst-case optimal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3314) native code and [outperforms Postgres](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2016/10/11/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/) on the Join Order Benchmark.

## CTO at Eve <http://witheve.com/>

#### Nov 2013 - Jan 2016

* Together with the CEO built a language and IDE which secured a [$2.3m seed round](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/01/eve-raises-2-3m-to-rethink-programming/) from Andreessen Horowitz.

* Created a live relational language based on temporal-logic extensions of datalog.

* Built relational databases, query planners and bootstrapped compilers for a series of prototypes (demonstrated in <https://youtu.be/VZQoAKJPbh8>).

* Wrote the [company research blog](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/archive/), which saw ~100k views/year.

* Spoke at the MIT Media Lab.

* Invited as a [resident](https://www.recurse.com/blog/68-a-small-step-in-a-new-direction) at the Recurse Center.

* Helped [release Light Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/2014/01/07/light-table-is-open-source/) as an open-source project.

* Sat on the program committee for the [Future of Programming Workshop](http://www.future-programming.org/2015/call.html).

## Consultant

#### May 2009 – Nov 2013

Highlighted commercial projects:

* Provided item-item article recommendations for Springer users based on ~600m past downloads. Uses locality-sensitive hashing and external sorting to run on a single low-powered server. 

* Built a prototype replacement for the core trading engine at the Smarkets betting exchange: 10x less code, 40x better throughput, 10x better 99% latency.

* Built a LaTeX aware search engine to power latexsearch.com. Covers the entire Springer library - more than 8m LaTeX equations. Searches by tree-edit distance on compressed syntax trees, using suffix arrays as a first-pass filter.

Highlighted personal projects:

* Extended the core.logic CLP solver with fair conjunction and a parallel solver.

* Built a clojure DSL for pattern matching and parsing using PEGs.

* Built a multi-user clojure REPL for collaborative live-coding.

## MSc Computer Science at Oxford University

#### Oct 2008 – Sep 2010

* Studied randomized algorithms, probabilistic model checking, logics of multi-agent information flow, machine learning and intelligent systems.

* Dissertation: [Design and analysis of a gossip overlay](https://github.com/jamii/dissertation/blob/master/writeup/main.pdf).

## BA Mathematics at University of Cambridge

#### Oct 2005 – July 2008

* Specialized in real analysis, discrete maths, probability and stochastic systems.
