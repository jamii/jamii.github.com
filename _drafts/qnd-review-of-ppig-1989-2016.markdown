### 1989

### 1990 

[Using Systematic Errors to Investigate the Developing Knowledge of Programming Language Learners](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Segal_0.pdf)

Two year programming class. 100 engineers. Errors in semicolon use concentrated on specific contexts, even though students have learned explicit syntax rules. Later errors become uniformly distributed ie attention lapses rather than misunderstanding.

Students don't learn syntax from specification of syntax - need contextualized experience. Parallel to natural language learning.

[Opportunistic Planning in the Specification Stage of Design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Visser_0.pdf) ([full paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00633544/document))

Single engineer observed writing spec in the wild for three weeks. Claimed to be following hierarchical plan but was observed deviating opportunistically. 

Tools should allow interrupting planning of one component to jump to another.

[Empirical Study of Design in an Object-Oriented Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Detienne_1.pdf)

8 experienced programmers - 4 OOP beginners, 4 OOP experienced. Up to one day to solve two problems. Observed heavy resuse of solutions/schemas once discovered.

### 1991

### 1992 

[ACE - An Application Construction Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Zarmer_0.pdf)

Framework for building end-user programming environments. Aims for progressive specialization where programmers hand-off partially finished environments to end-users. No study on actual users.

[Addressing the psychology of programming in programming language design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Bell-NC_0.pdf)

Judge programming language by breaking writing down into steps, and look at how much knowledge required to choose between options at each step. Novel language, observe four paper writers working through problems. Example of a macro feature where the correct choice is not clear.

Provides a method for evaluating how natural/obvious a given language or feature is.

[An analysis of novice programmers learning a second language](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Scholtz_0.pdf)

Studies transfer of 'plans' learned in Pascal to Ada or Icon. 13 students with Pascal experience. 3 work in Pascal, 5 in Ada, 5 in Icon. Observed, broken into episodes, episodes classified by consensus.

[GPT's preparation of students for programming in the real world](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Dawson_0.pdf)

Two week industrial course for new graduate hires. Subjects forced to work only in company hours - no last-minute rush - teaches important of planning/scheduling. Role-play vague and unhelpful customer. Uni courses have to be fair => perfect environment - better learning from realistic disruptions.

[Possible extensions to the Byrd Box tracer aimed at experts](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Hook_0.pdf)

Proposes study of how expert Prolog programmers use tracer. Didn't actually perform study.

[Programming in the Real World: Computer Science students' perceptions of the values and difficulties of learning formal methods](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-OShea_0.pdf)

2nd and 3rd year students. 51 returned questionnaire and some were interviewed? Focused on four courses that use formal methods.

Students struggle to manipulate formal expressions by hand. Need automated tools. Only realized relevance of early course much later, when it was too late. Don't believe that formal methods are used 'in the real world'.

[Restricting manipulations within a device space: Effects upon strategy, errors and display-based problem solving](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Davies_0.pdf)

Do expert programmers develop better working memory, or do they learn to use external memory more effectively? Notice that experts jump around more often, while beginners tend towards linear program generation. 

10 professionals. 12 2nd year undergrads. 

Experiment 1. Have to program while speaking strings of digits - strains working memory. Expert performance did not suffer. Novices have more errors under suppression, and jump around code more often.

Experiment 2. Write a program using a program that doesn't allow lines to be edited after hitting enter. Experts produce more errors than novices in this environment. 

Suggests that experts don't develop more working memory, but instead switch to strategies that use external memory more.

[Programming with a purpose: Hank, gardening and schema theory](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1999-PPIG-11th-mulholland.pdf)

Visual language for cognitive modeling. Focus is not on building models but on understanding them. Used for student project. Questionnaire at end of course, qualitative analysis.

Students liked having no textual syntax. Found it easier to understand Hank models than Prolog models. Able to understand each others programs. Could understand execution process. Hank was useable with pen and paper.

[Mental representation and imagery in program comprehension](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1999-PPIG-11th-navarro.pdf)

32 c programmers. 32 spreadsheet programmers. Checking whether programmers build mental models based on control flow or data flow.

45 students. Given single line, judge how likely it is to have come from a binary search. Ratings(?) influenced by expertise.

30 students. Given single line, map it to one of three algorithms. Unclear results.

19 students. Shown algorithm and asked to comprehend/memorize (under eyetracker). Then given comprehension test. Divide sections of code into categories, normalize time in each category by screen area. Experienced group focused more on 'complex' category.

[The Misplaced Comma: Programmers' Tales and Traditions](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-marshall.pdf)

Speculation on programmer folklore.

[Softening the Complexity of Intelligent Systems Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-lynch.pdf)

HCI researcher compares pattern languages to cognitive dimensions. 

[On Concurrency in Educational Software Authoring Systems](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-mostrom.pdf)

Educators given animations of systems and asked to describe how they work. 

No coding or statistical analysis. 

Inexperienced subjects tended to describe each entity until influenced by external event. Suggests describing systems in terms of individual behaviors and cross-entity conditions for behavior change. 

[Modelling Software Organisations](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-hales_0.pdf)

Proposes agent-based modeling of software organizations.

[A Comparison of Empirical Study and Cognitive Dimensions Analysis in the Evaluation of UML Diagrams](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-kutar.pdf)

Two different notations for UML diagrams. CD analysis favours one. Multiple-choice exam given to students shows no significant difference.

### 2003

[A development study of cogntive problems in learning to program](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-tucker.pdf)

Anecdotal reports from programming course.

Students can often give the correct code without understanding how it works. Often mislearn concepts, while making the correct noises.

[An ethnography of XP practice](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-sharp-robinson.pdf)

Very similar to previous paper.

[Applying Cognitive load theory to computer science education](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-shaffer.pdf)

Ideas for how to reduce cognitive load when teaching programming.

Empirical studies of programmers tend to take place in very artificial settings. Plans to study programmers in-situ.

[Cognitive Dimensions of tangible programming techniques](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-blackwell.pdf)

At lexical level TUIs provide no advantage - too small a vocabulary, no established conventional symbols, no significant improvement in interaction speed or recall.

At syntactic level - more possible kinds of relationships (position, orientation, proximity...), input-only interface (eg no undo).

[Cognitive Dimensions questionnaire applied to visual languages evaluation - a case study](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-bobkowska.pdf)

CD questionnaire given to 2(!) subjects. Both were critical of the questionnaire.

Categorize variables into one of 10 roles. 

Taught 80 students with a) normal methods b) variable roles c) variable roles + animated simulator which shows roles. 

Conclusion is confusing - raw data looks to me like roles group did worse in their final exam, but author claims that poor grading was the cause.

[Investigating the influence of structure of user performance with UML interaction diagrams](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-kutar.pdf)

Tries again with the two different UML notation. Three different studies show no difference in performance.

[Software Effort Estimation: unstructured group discussion as a method to reduce individual biasis](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-molokken.pdf)

Groups of programmers produce less over-optimistic estimates than individual programmers (effect size 1.25).

Seems similar to proposed mechanism in Superforecasters - if estimate is ideal time + list of things-that-might-go-wrong, then compiling things-that-might-go-wrong from whole group should provide better coverage.

[Some parallels between empirical software engineering and research in human computer interaction](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-segal.pdf)

Current experiments in psych-prog do not inform practice. HCI faced similar criticism in previous decades and changed focus from lab experiments to field studies.

[Using cognitive dimensions to compare prototyping techniques](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-dearden.pdf)

CD analysis suggests that existing categorization of prototyping tools into lo- and hi-fidelity is not enough. 

Identifies 4 key activities: authoring, validation, implementation, confirmation. Not clear how these relate to categorization.

[Using laddering and on-line self-report to elicit design rationale for software](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-sherlock.pdf)

Design rationale may not be available as explicit, conscious, verbalizable knowledge. 

Authors elicit rationale from students designing web pages using real-time self-reporting and laddering. (Laddering seems similar to root-cause analysis, but for exploring knowledge rather than causes).

[Using the cognitive dimensions framework to measure the usability of a class library](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-clarke.pdf)

Suggests a variant CD specifically designed for evaluating libraries.
