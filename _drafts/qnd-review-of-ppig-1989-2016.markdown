### 1989

### 1990 

[Using Systematic Errors to Investigate the Developing Knowledge of Programming Language Learners](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Segal_0.pdf)

Two year programming class. 100 engineers. Errors in semicolon use concentrated on specific contexts, even though students have learned explicit syntax rules. Later errors become uniformly distributed ie attention lapses rather than misunderstanding.

Students don't learn syntax from specification of syntax - need contextualized experience. Parallel to natural language learning.

[Opportunistic Planning in the Specification Stage of Design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Visser_0.pdf) ([full paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00633544/document))

Single engineer observed writing spec in the wild for three weeks. Claimed to be following hierarchical plan but was observed deviating opportunistically. 

Tools should allow interrupting planning of one component to jump to another.

[Empirical Study of Design in an Object-Oriented Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Detienne_1.pdf)

8 experienced programmers - 4 OOP beginners, 4 OOP experienced. Up to one day to solve two problems. Observed heavy resuse of solutions/schemas once discovered.

### 1991

### 1992 

[ACE - An Application Construction Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Zarmer_0.pdf)

Framework for building end-user programming environments. Aims for progressive specialization where programmers hand-off partially finished environments to end-users. No study on actual users.

[Addressing the psychology of programming in programming language design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Bell-NC_0.pdf)

Judge programming language by breaking writing down into steps, and look at how much knowledge required to choose between options at each step. Novel language, observe four paper writers working through problems. Example of a macro feature where the correct choice is not clear.

Provides a method for evaluating how natural/obvious a given language or feature is.

[An analysis of novice programmers learning a second language](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Scholtz_0.pdf)

Studies transfer of 'plans' learned in Pascal to Ada or Icon. 13 students with Pascal experience. 3 work in Pascal, 5 in Ada, 5 in Icon. Observed, broken into episodes, episodes classified by consensus.

[GPT's preparation of students for programming in the real world](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Dawson_0.pdf)

Two week industrial course for new graduate hires. Subjects forced to work only in company hours - no last-minute rush - teaches important of planning/scheduling. Role-play vague and unhelpful customer. Uni courses have to be fair => perfect environment - better learning from realistic disruptions.

[Possible extensions to the Byrd Box tracer aimed at experts](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Hook_0.pdf)

Proposes study of how expert Prolog programmers use tracer. Didn't actually perform study.

[Programming in the Real World: Computer Science students' perceptions of the values and difficulties of learning formal methods](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-OShea_0.pdf)

2nd and 3rd year students. 51 returned questionnaire and some were interviewed? Focused on four courses that use formal methods.

Students struggle to manipulate formal expressions by hand. Need automated tools. Only realized relevance of early course much later, when it was too late. Don't believe that formal methods are used 'in the real world'.

[Restricting manipulations within a device space: Effects upon strategy, errors and display-based problem solving](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Davies_0.pdf)

Do expert programmers develop better working memory, or do they learn to use external memory more effectively? Notice that experts jump around more often, while beginners tend towards linear program generation. 

10 professionals. 12 2nd year undergrads. 

Experiment 1. Have to program while speaking strings of digits - strains working memory. Expert performance did not suffer. Novices have more errors under suppression, and jump around code more often.

Experiment 2. Write a program using a program that doesn't allow lines to be edited after hitting enter. Experts produce more errors than novices in this environment. 

Suggests that experts don't develop more working memory, but instead switch to strategies that use external memory more.

45 students. Given single line, judge how likely it is to have come from a binary search. Ratings(?) influenced by expertise.

30 students. Given single line, map it to one of three algorithms. Unclear results.

19 students. Shown algorithm and asked to comprehend/memorize (under eyetracker). Then given comprehension test. Divide sections of code into categories, normalize time in each category by screen area. Experienced group focused more on 'complex' category.

[The Misplaced Comma: Programmers' Tales and Traditions](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-marshall.pdf)

Speculation on programmer folklore.

[Softening the Complexity of Intelligent Systems Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-lynch.pdf)

[On Concurrency in Educational Software Authoring Systems](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-mostrom.pdf)

Educators given animations of systems and asked to describe how they work. 

No coding or statistical analysis. 

Inexperienced subjects tended to describe each entity until influenced by external event. Suggests describing systems in terms of individual behaviors and cross-entity conditions for behavior change. 

[Modelling Software Organisations](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-hales_0.pdf)

Proposes agent-based modeling of software organizations.

[A Comparison of Empirical Study and Cognitive Dimensions Analysis in the Evaluation of UML Diagrams](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-kutar.pdf)

Two different notations for UML diagrams. CD analysis favours one. Multiple-choice exam given to students shows no significant difference.

### 2003

[A development study of cogntive problems in learning to program](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-tucker.pdf)

Anecdotal reports from programming course.

Students can often give the correct code without understanding how it works. Often mislearn concepts, while making the correct noises.

[An ethnography of XP practice](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-sharp-robinson.pdf)

Very similar to previous paper.

[Applying Cognitive load theory to computer science education](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-shaffer.pdf)

Ideas for how to reduce cognitive load when teaching programming.

[Cognitive Dimensions of tangible programming techniques](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-blackwell.pdf)

At lexical level TUIs provide no advantage - too small a vocabulary, no established conventional symbols, no significant improvement in interaction speed or recall.

At syntactic level - more possible kinds of relationships (position, orientation, proximity...), input-only interface (eg no undo).

[Cognitive Dimensions questionnaire applied to visual languages evaluation - a case study](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-bobkowska.pdf)

CD questionnaire given to 2(!) subjects. Both were critical of the questionnaire.

Categorize variables into one of 10 roles. 

Taught 80 students with a) normal methods b) variable roles c) variable roles + animated simulator which shows roles. 

Conclusion is confusing - raw data looks to me like roles group did worse in their final exam, but author claims that poor grading was the cause.

[Investigating the influence of structure of user performance with UML interaction diagrams](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-kutar.pdf)

Tries again with the two different UML notation. Three different studies show no difference in performance.

[Software Effort Estimation: unstructured group discussion as a method to reduce individual biasis](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-molokken.pdf)

Groups of programmers produce less over-optimistic estimates than individual programmers (effect size 1.25).

Seems similar to proposed mechanism in Superforecasters - if estimate is ideal time + list of things-that-might-go-wrong, then compiling things-that-might-go-wrong from whole group should provide better coverage.

[Some parallels between empirical software engineering and research in human computer interaction](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-segal.pdf)

Current experiments in psych-prog do not inform practice. HCI faced similar criticism in previous decades and changed focus from lab experiments to field studies.

CD analysis suggests that existing categorization of prototyping tools into lo- and hi-fidelity is not enough. 

Identifies 4 key activities: authoring, validation, implementation, confirmation. Not clear how these relate to categorization.

[Using laddering and on-line self-report to elicit design rationale for software](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-sherlock.pdf)

Design rationale may not be available as explicit, conscious, verbalizable knowledge. 

Authors elicit rationale from students designing web pages using real-time self-reporting and laddering. (Laddering seems similar to root-cause analysis, but for exploring knowledge rather than causes).

[Using the cognitive dimensions framework to measure the usability of a class library](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-clarke.pdf)

[Challenges, Motivations, and Success Factors in the Creation of Hurricane Katrina "Person Locator" Web Sites](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2006-PPIG-18th-scaffidi.pdf)

Interviewed team leaders of 6 person locator websites. None looked for existing sites or teams before starting. All resisted aggregators combining their content.

[An Experiment on the Effects of Program Code Highlighting on Visual Search for Local Patterns](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2006-PPIG-18th-hakala.pdf)

21 students. Asked to find various program fragments. Two syntax highlighting schemes had no significant effect vs black-on-white control.

[Abstraction levels in editing programs](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2006-PPIG-18th-sturdy.pdf)

Comparing structured editing to text editing. No results yet. 

[A Competence Model for Object-Interaction in Introductory Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2006-PPIG-18th-bennedsen.pdf)

Proposes hierarchy of understanding for OOP execution model. 125 students given questionnaire followed by test. Results appear to agree with hierarchy, but some questionable change to data before analysis. 

### 2007

[Usability Assessment of a UML-based Formal Modelling Method](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Razali.pdf)

Model that combines UML and B. Compared to B alone. 41 students assigned comprehension and modification tasks. UML-B scored higher.

10 students given CD questionnaire on UML-B.

[The Learning of Recursive Algorithms from a Psychogenetic Perspective](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-daRosa.pdf)

Give students recursive definition of a language, ask them various questions about it and then ask them to write various recursive functions on the language.

Talks up the benefits of this approach but it's not clear to me from a quick reading what the difference is.

[Student Attitude Towards Automatic and Manual Exercise and Evaluation Systems](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Tokola.pdf)

Survey given to 455 students with 23% reply rate. Students trust automated systems more. Worried that human contact would be reduced.

[SQ Minus EQ can Predict Programming Aptitude](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Wray.pdf)

19 students given Autism Research Centres EQ and SQ tests. Both correlate with programming test (.44, -.45, p~=.05), combined score correlates more (.67, p=.002). (Combined score also known to correlate with autism spectrum).

Suggested explanation is that high SQ-EQ makes students more likely to rack up hours messing with computers.

[Spatial Ability and Learning to Program](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Jones.pdf)

49 students in MSc IT. Mental rotation test correlates with success at 0.48. Acknowledges that students with high spatial ability are known to be more likely to pick engineering courses.

[Problem Solving in Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Gomes.pdf)

Argues that students struggly in programming because they lack basic problem solving skills ala Polya. Propses tool that nudges students through the basic process eg making them list what data is known and what unknowns need to be solved.

[Moods and Programmers' Performance](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Khan.pdf)

Make 72 programmers watch short video clips before debugging test. Small effect on arousal axis, but poor power.

[Introducing Learning into Automatic Program Comprehension](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Gerdt.pdf)

Use machine learning for understanding programs. Example of extracting variable roles. Not clear what the learning algorithm is or how it's applied.

[From Procedures to Objects: What Have We (Not) Done?](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Sajaniemi.pdf)

Procedural to OO has been a big shift for teaching. Can't assume that psych results will carry over.

Some of the that is claims are totally unstudied seem to have been published in previous PPIG papers. 

[Expert strategies for dealing with complex and intractable problems](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Petre.pdf)

In-field observation and interviews of 10 programmers working on large complex problems. No body.

[Example of Using Narratives in Teaching Programming: Roles of Variables](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Timcenko.pdf)

Anecdotal observations of teaching kids to program using narratives and variable roles - placing kids in the role of a particular variable and playing out live.

[ESCAPE Meta Modelling in Software Engineering: When Premature Commitment is Useful in Representations](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Buckley.pdf)

Advocates for process of explicitly stating models and (manually or automatically) looking for contradictions in reality to refine the model.

Main example is software tool for expressing explicit models of how software operates. User maps model to code. Tool shows where system violates their model eg calls between two components that don't have a dependency in the model. 

READ

[Assisting Concept Location in Software Comprehension](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Cleary.pdf)

Code search that is aware of documentation? Too much jargon, no idea what the tool actually does.

[Analysing and Interpreting Quantitative Eye-Tracking Data in Studies of Programming: Phases of Debugging with Multiple Representations](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Bednarik.pdf)

Eye-tracking data is hard to analyze. Complex tasks, difficult to map into simple components for hypothesis testing.

Broke previous data into small chunks and looked at trends over time and switching patterns between activities. 

[An Experiment on the Effects of Engagement and Representation in Program Animation Perception](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Nevalainen.pdf)

PlanAni again. 24 students. Two tests under eye-tracking - 1) predict variable values 2) choose inputs to produce particular values.

Various numbers produced but no idea what they were actually trying to find out.

[An Experiential Report on the Limitations of Experimentation as a Means of Empirical Investigation](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Exton.pdf)

Failed experiment. Subject sampling/participation messed up by other commitments. Much of the data is missing because subjects didn't get around to writing it down. Two groups behaved so differently in collaborative stage as to be effectively different experiments.

[A Roles-Based Approach to Variable-Oriented Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Sorva.pdf)

Proposes language design to focus on variable roles.

[A multidimensional framework for analysing collaborative design: emergence and balance of roles](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Detienne.pdf)

No body.

[A Coding Scheme Development Methodology Using Grounded Theory for Qualitative Analysis of Pair Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Salinger.pdf)

Attempting to use GT initially failed. Transcription of recording was impractical so directly annotated the video. Overwhelmed by possible choice of features because they had no actual goal. 

Suggests choosing feature categories before starting coding, using structured names for concepts, making a UML model for results, pair coding.

[A Categorization of Novice Programmers: A Cluster Analysis Study](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2007-PPIG-19th-Lahtinen.pdf)

Want to be able to group students by current skill level for better targeted teaching.

Give a test to 254 students that follows Blooms Taxonomy. Cluster students by results - observed non-linear skill progression.

### 2008

[XP Team Psychology - An Inside View](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-lechner.pdf)

Anecdotal report from team of PhD students using XP. 

[What Happens During Pair Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-salinger.pdf)

GT concepts for pair programming.

[Using Mapping Studies in Software Engineering](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-budgen.pdf)

Several examples of mapping studies. Notes that coverage is low, both in the mapping studies themselves and in the areas they address.

[Towards a Computer Interaction-Based Mood Measure Instrument](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-kahn.pdf)

Trying to determine mood from mouse and keyboard logs. Analysis is awful.

[Thinking about Thinking in Objects: Methods, Findings and Implications from a Psychological Perspective](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-exton.pdf)

OOPy folks argue that thinking in terms of objects is innate. Relates various psych findings that don't seem to actually be related to OOP objects. Confusion over the word.

[The Stores Model of Code Cognition](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-douce.pdf)

Models code cognition in terms of various memory types.

[The Importance of Cognitive and Usability Elements in Designing Software Visualization Tools](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-carneiro.pdf)

Designing software with multiple views. Not strongly justified.

[The Abstract is an Enemy: Alternative Perspectives to Computational Thinking](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-blackwell.pdf)

Reality is messy, has to be abstracted away to fit in tidy computers. What could go wrong?

Not very convincing examples.

[Structured Text Modification Using Guided Inference](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-church.pdf)

Tools that infers regexes from positive/negative examples. Evaluation with 6 subjects vs manual editing with Word and vs manual rename with Adobe Bridge. Large effect size. 

[Scientists and Software Engineers: A Tale of Two Cultures](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-segal.pdf)

Culture clashes between devs and scientists, especially in waterfall style dev.

[Observing Open Source Programmers' Information Seeking](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-sharif.pdf)

More mailing list data-mining. Conclusions are banal.

[MBTI Personality Type and Student Code Comprehension Skill](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-greathead.pdf)

74 students take MBTI test and code comprehension test. Introversion slightly predicts success.

[Intuition in Software Development Revisited](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-beynon.pdf)

Philosophizing.

[Integrating Extreme Programming and User-Centered Design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-hussain.pdf)

Largely seems to be about integrating mock-ups and end-user testing into XP workflow.

[An MCL Algorithm Based Technique for Comprehending Spreadsheets](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-kankuzi.pdf)

Using Markov Clustering to try to retrieve logical cell blocks. Minimal evaluation.

[A Study of Visualization in Introductory Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-kasurinen.pdf)

LOGO clone. Slight improvement in course participation in same year.

[A Loop is a Compression](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-milner.pdf)

Suggests that loops are hard because there is not a 1-1 mapping between text and execution.

[A Longitudinal Study of Depth of Inheritance and its Effects on Programmer Maintenance Effort](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-creegan.pdf)

Data-mining Eclipse repo. Inheritance depth did not predict refactorings.

[A Lightweight Systematic Literature Review of Studies about the Use of Pair Programming to Teach Introductory Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-turner.pdf)

Testing out systematic lit review with 1 student. Seems to work. 

[A Comparison Between Student and Professional Pair Programmers](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2008-PPIG-20th-plonka.pdf)

10 students and 6 professionals recorded pair programming. Significant differences in their behavior mean that past studies on students probably can't be extrapolated.

### 2009 

[Using computerized procedures for testing and training abstract comparative relations](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-vitale.pdf)

Subjects given two comparisons eg A>B and B>C and have to report what mapping from A,B,C to small,medium,large can be deduced. Success rates between 50% and 100% depending on class of problem.

10 subjects. Three sessions. Small but significant increase in performance over time.

10 subjects. Replaced middle session with 'training session' - same interface but explains answers. Near 100% success rates on last session.

[Good Programmers: Nature or Nurture? (The bed of Procrustes)](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-exton.pdf)

General discussion of nature vs nurture as it pertains to psychometrics. Doesn't really say anything specific about programming.

[Types of Cooperation Episodes in Side-by-Side Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-prechelt.pdf)

Observation of 10 grad students learning Java. GT concepts again. 

[Software Architects: A Different Type of Software Practitioner](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-downey.pdf)

Interviewed software architects about projects. Found that they weren't really focused on the projects so the interviews were pointless.

[Mining Programming Language Vocabularies from Source Code](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-delorey.pdf)

Text-mining JDK. Doesn't seem to have any new results from their past paper.

[Meta-analysis of the effect of consistency on success in early learning of programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-dehnadi_0.pdf)

6 attempted replications of consistent-mental-model-predicts-programming-ability experiment. 

First failure had too very high pass rates - almost all of the students were consistent. Second failure was a test given after the course - expect that a programming course should teach students to pass the test (this objection doesn't actually seem to me to make sense).

Improved protocol, detailed in previous paper.

Next four replications from author and collaborators. All seem to be somewhat successful. 

[Initial Exploration of Eye Movements in Collaborative Work: Case Pair Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-pietinen.pdf)

Eye-tracking during pair programming. Method and results are not really clear.

[Further Observation of Open Source Programmers‚Äô Information Seeking](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-sharif.pdf)

Yet more mailing list mining. Low response rate. No other interesting observations.

[Examining the Structural Features of Systems Developed in C++ and Java](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-english.pdf)

10 C++ and 10 Java projects out of top 100 sourceforge downloads. Conclusions seem to be far too strong given the metrics examined eg low number of protected methods -> not enough use of information hiding.

[Design Requirements for an Architecture Consistency Tool](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-rosik.pdf)

Reflexion modeling for fighting architectural drift. 2 year longitudinal study at IBM Dublin. Discovered many violations of the model, but they generally weren't removed. Designed a CI version of the tool to catch violations as they happen.

[Concrete Thoughts on Abstraction](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-nicholson.pdf)

Tries to break effective use of abstraction down into subskills.

[Computer Code as a Medium for Human Communication: Are Programming Languages Improving?](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-dubochet.pdf)

12 subjects given code comprehension task in either Java or Scala under eye-tracker. The dense Scala code was more quickly understood.

[Communication in Testing: Improvements for Testing Management](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-paakkonen.pdf)

Survey answered by 23/60 professionals in single company. Reported poor overall visibility of test state, poor coordination between departments.

[Cognitive levels and Software Maintenance Sub-tasks](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-kelly.pdf)

6 professionals talk-aloud in maintenance tasks at work. Tries to code utterances into Bloom taxonomy. Not clear what they are looking for.

[Can Named Ranges Improve the Debugging Performance of Novice Spreadsheet Users?](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-mckeever.pdf)

21 students asked to debug spreadsheet that uses named ranges. Uses previous experiment as control. Worse performance than control. 

Tries to justify use of separate control by comparing error distribution to control group in a different (and properly randomized) experiment.

[An Evaluation of inline source code browsing](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-desmond.pdf)

Tool opens source code inline instead of jumping to different file.

7 subjects given various comprehension tasks. 14% faster with inline. No significance test.

[A Course Dedicated to Developing Algorithmic Problem Solving Skills - Design and Experiment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2009-PPIG-21st-muller.pdf)

Problem-solving course. Students reportedly approve. No other evaluation.
