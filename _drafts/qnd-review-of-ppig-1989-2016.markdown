### 1989

### 1990 

[Using Systematic Errors to Investigate the Developing Knowledge of Programming Language Learners](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Segal_0.pdf)

Two year programming class. 100 engineers. Errors in semicolon use concentrated on specific contexts, even though students have learned explicit syntax rules. Later errors become uniformly distributed ie attention lapses rather than misunderstanding.

Students don't learn syntax from specification of syntax - need contextualized experience. Parallel to natural language learning.

[Opportunistic Planning in the Specification Stage of Design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Visser_0.pdf) ([full paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00633544/document))

Single engineer observed writing spec in the wild for three weeks. Claimed to be following hierarchical plan but was observed deviating opportunistically. 

Tools should allow interrupting planning of one component to jump to another.

[Empirical Study of Design in an Object-Oriented Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Detienne_1.pdf)

8 experienced programmers - 4 OOP beginners, 4 OOP experienced. Up to one day to solve two problems. Observed heavy resuse of solutions/schemas once discovered.

### 1991

### 1992 

[ACE - An Application Construction Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Zarmer_0.pdf)

Framework for building end-user programming environments. Aims for progressive specialization where programmers hand-off partially finished environments to end-users. No study on actual users.

[Addressing the psychology of programming in programming language design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Bell-NC_0.pdf)

Judge programming language by breaking writing down into steps, and look at how much knowledge required to choose between options at each step. Novel language, observe four paper writers working through problems. Example of a macro feature where the correct choice is not clear.

Provides a method for evaluating how natural/obvious a given language or feature is.

[An analysis of novice programmers learning a second language](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Scholtz_0.pdf)

Studies transfer of 'plans' learned in Pascal to Ada or Icon. 13 students with Pascal experience. 3 work in Pascal, 5 in Ada, 5 in Icon. Observed, broken into episodes, episodes classified by consensus.

[GPT's preparation of students for programming in the real world](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Dawson_0.pdf)

Two week industrial course for new graduate hires. Subjects forced to work only in company hours - no last-minute rush - teaches important of planning/scheduling. Role-play vague and unhelpful customer. Uni courses have to be fair => perfect environment - better learning from realistic disruptions.

[Possible extensions to the Byrd Box tracer aimed at experts](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Hook_0.pdf)

Proposes study of how expert Prolog programmers use tracer. Didn't actually perform study.

[Programming in the Real World: Computer Science students' perceptions of the values and difficulties of learning formal methods](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-OShea_0.pdf)

2nd and 3rd year students. 51 returned questionnaire and some were interviewed? Focused on four courses that use formal methods.

Students struggle to manipulate formal expressions by hand. Need automated tools. Only realized relevance of early course much later, when it was too late. Don't believe that formal methods are used 'in the real world'.

[Restricting manipulations within a device space: Effects upon strategy, errors and display-based problem solving](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Davies_0.pdf)

Do expert programmers develop better working memory, or do they learn to use external memory more effectively? Notice that experts jump around more often, while beginners tend towards linear program generation. 

10 professionals. 12 2nd year undergrads. 

Experiment 1. Have to program while speaking strings of digits - strains working memory. Expert performance did not suffer. Novices have more errors under suppression, and jump around code more often.

Experiment 2. Write a program using a program that doesn't allow lines to be edited after hitting enter. Experts produce more errors than novices in this environment. 

Suggests that experts don't develop more working memory, but instead switch to strategies that use external memory more.

18 1st year undergrads. Graphical vs tabular vs narrative representation of design rationale. Options-based vs criteria-based (unclear on meaning). 

Narrative format had slower response times, fewer correct answers. Graphical and tabular were matched. Criteria-based had similar times to option-based but more correct answers.

[Programming with a purpose: Hank, gardening and schema theory](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1999-PPIG-11th-mulholland.pdf)

Visual language for cognitive modeling. Focus is not on building models but on understanding them. Used for student project. Questionnaire at end of course, qualitative analysis.

Students liked having no textual syntax. Found it easier to understand Hank models than Prolog models. Able to understand each others programs. Could understand execution process. Hank was useable with pen and paper.

[Mental representation and imagery in program comprehension](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1999-PPIG-11th-navarro.pdf)

32 c programmers. 32 spreadsheet programmers. Checking whether programmers build mental models based on control flow or data flow. Used recognition task with priming to see whether recognition is improved by primes nearby in control flow or nearby in data flow. Not clear what language the test program was in or how distance is judged in each model.

Interpretation of results is not clear to me.

16 novices. 16 experts. Showed a program for 2 or 10 seconds. Asked 5 comprehension questions. Experts perform better in both 2s and 10s cases. Data- and control- flow questions benefit from 10s more than function, operation and state questions.

[Experiences with novices: The importance of graphical representations in supporting mental mode](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2000-PPIG-12th-george.pdf)

Trying to teach beginners the mental representation of recursion used by experts. 

49 students taught to use a diagrammatic representation of recursive programs. Test mental model by giving a list of possible solutions and asking which ones work correctly. Students who were tested with diagrams made fewer errors than students who tested with diagrams ie model was learned but failed to transfer to normal code.
