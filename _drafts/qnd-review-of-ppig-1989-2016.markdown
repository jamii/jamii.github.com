### 1989

### 1990 

[Using Systematic Errors to Investigate the Developing Knowledge of Programming Language Learners](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Segal_0.pdf)

Two year programming class. 100 engineers. Errors in semicolon use concentrated on specific contexts, even though students have learned explicit syntax rules. Later errors become uniformly distributed ie attention lapses rather than misunderstanding.

Students don't learn syntax from specification of syntax - need contextualized experience. Parallel to natural language learning.

[Opportunistic Planning in the Specification Stage of Design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Visser_0.pdf) ([full paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00633544/document))

Single engineer observed writing spec in the wild for three weeks. Claimed to be following hierarchical plan but was observed deviating opportunistically. 

Tools should allow interrupting planning of one component to jump to another.

[Empirical Study of Design in an Object-Oriented Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1990-PPIG-2nd-Detienne_1.pdf)

8 experienced programmers - 4 OOP beginners, 4 OOP experienced. Up to one day to solve two problems. Observed heavy resuse of solutions/schemas once discovered.

### 1991

### 1992 

[ACE - An Application Construction Environment](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Zarmer_0.pdf)

Framework for building end-user programming environments. Aims for progressive specialization where programmers hand-off partially finished environments to end-users. No study on actual users.

[Addressing the psychology of programming in programming language design](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Bell-NC_0.pdf)

Judge programming language by breaking writing down into steps, and look at how much knowledge required to choose between options at each step. Novel language, observe four paper writers working through problems. Example of a macro feature where the correct choice is not clear.

Provides a method for evaluating how natural/obvious a given language or feature is.

[An analysis of novice programmers learning a second language](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Scholtz_0.pdf)

Studies transfer of 'plans' learned in Pascal to Ada or Icon. 13 students with Pascal experience. 3 work in Pascal, 5 in Ada, 5 in Icon. Observed, broken into episodes, episodes classified by consensus.

[GPT's preparation of students for programming in the real world](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Dawson_0.pdf)

Two week industrial course for new graduate hires. Subjects forced to work only in company hours - no last-minute rush - teaches important of planning/scheduling. Role-play vague and unhelpful customer. Uni courses have to be fair => perfect environment - better learning from realistic disruptions.

[Possible extensions to the Byrd Box tracer aimed at experts](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Hook_0.pdf)

Proposes study of how expert Prolog programmers use tracer. Didn't actually perform study.

[Programming in the Real World: Computer Science students' perceptions of the values and difficulties of learning formal methods](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-OShea_0.pdf)

2nd and 3rd year students. 51 returned questionnaire and some were interviewed? Focused on four courses that use formal methods.

Students struggle to manipulate formal expressions by hand. Need automated tools. Only realized relevance of early course much later, when it was too late. Don't believe that formal methods are used 'in the real world'.

[Restricting manipulations within a device space: Effects upon strategy, errors and display-based problem solving](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/1992-PPIG-4th-Davies_0.pdf)

Do expert programmers develop better working memory, or do they learn to use external memory more effectively? Notice that experts jump around more often, while beginners tend towards linear program generation. 

10 professionals. 12 2nd year undergrads. 

Experiment 1. Have to program while speaking strings of digits - strains working memory. Expert performance did not suffer. Novices have more errors under suppression, and jump around code more often.

Experiment 2. Write a program using a program that doesn't allow lines to be edited after hitting enter. Experts produce more errors than novices in this environment. 

Suggests that experts don't develop more working memory, but instead switch to strategies that use external memory more.

Studying language high-school students use.

### 2002

[Shared Data or Message-Passing - A Human Factor in Technical Choices?](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-Sodan-Capretz-mbti.pdf)

How do people choose between the two? Give parallel programming problems to students along with Myers-Brigg test. 

Hugely forking paths. Only 0-3 students per MBTI / shared-mv-messaging intersection. 

[What is Programming?](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-blackwell.pdf)

Break variables into different types - constant, counter, control etc. Apply different graphics when visualizing program. 

No evaluation.

[The Roles Beacons Play in Comprehension for Novice and Expert Programmers](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-crosby.pdf)

45 students. Given single line, judge how likely it is to have come from a binary search. Ratings(?) influenced by expertise.

30 students. Given single line, map it to one of three algorithms. Unclear results.

19 students. Shown algorithm and asked to comprehend/memorize (under eyetracker). Then given comprehension test. Divide sections of code into categories, normalize time in each category by screen area. Experienced group focused more on 'complex' category.

[The Misplaced Comma: Programmers' Tales and Traditions](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-marshall.pdf)

Speculation on programmer folklore.

[Softening the Complexity of Intelligent Systems Programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-lynch.pdf)

Students struggle surprisingly with symbolic systems. May be caused by overhead of manipulating data-structures. Suggest pattern-matching support in language to help.

[Revitalising Old Thoughts: Class diagrams in Light of the Early Wittgenstein](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-holmboe.pdf)

...

[Programming Aptitude Testing as a Prediction of Learning to Program](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-tukiainen.pdf)

33 students. No significant correlation between VB course final exam grade and high-school grades or SAT grades. Huoman programming aptitude test explains 25% of final grade. 

[Patterns for HCI and Cognitive Dimensions: Two Halves of the Same Story?](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-fincher.pdf)

HCI researcher compares pattern languages to cognitive dimensions. 

[On Concurrency in Educational Software Authoring Systems](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-mostrom.pdf)

Educators given animations of systems and asked to describe how they work. 

No coding or statistical analysis. 

Inexperienced subjects tended to describe each entity until influenced by external event. Suggests describing systems in terms of individual behaviors and cross-entity conditions for behavior change. 

[Modelling Software Organisations](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-hales_0.pdf)

Proposes agent-based modeling of software organizations. 

[Making the Analogy: Alternative Delivery Techniques for First Year Programming Courses](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-dunican.pdf)

Anecdotal reports from lecturer of first-year programming course.

3 main problems. Students have no prior exposure to computational thinking, or even basic logic. No familiar experience to compare most programming concepts to. Unused to rigid syntax rules.  

Suggests several analogies for use in teaching.

[Learning Styles in Distance Education Students Learning to Program](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-logan.pdf)

Distance learning students. Given questionnaire to assess learning style.

[A Comparison of Empirical Study and Cognitive Dimensions Analysis in the Evaluation of UML Diagrams](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2002-PPIG-14th-kutar.pdf)

Two different notations for UML diagrams. CD analysis favours one. Multiple-choice exam given to students shows no significant difference.

### 2003

[A development study of cogntive problems in learning to program](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-tucker.pdf)

Anecdotal reports from programming course.

Students can often give the correct code without understanding how it works. Often mislearn concepts, while making the correct noises.

[An ethnography of XP practice](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-sharp-robinson.pdf)

Very similar to previous paper.

[Applying Cognitive load theory to computer science education](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-shaffer.pdf)

Ideas for how to reduce cognitive load when teaching programming.

Empirical studies of programmers tend to take place in very artificial settings. Plans to study programmers in-situ.

[Cognitive Dimensions of tangible programming techniques](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-blackwell.pdf)

At lexical level TUIs provide no advantage - too small a vocabulary, no established conventional symbols, no significant improvement in interaction speed or recall.

At syntactic level - more possible kinds of relationships (position, orientation, proximity...), input-only interface (eg no undo).

[Cognitive Dimensions questionnaire applied to visual languages evaluation - a case study](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-bobkowska.pdf)

CD questionnaire given to 2(!) subjects. Both were critical of the questionnaire.

Brief survey finds mixed support for visualization in programming tools.

[First results of an experiment on using roles of variables in teaching](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-kuittinen.pdf)

Categorize variables into one of 10 roles. 

Taught 80 students with a) normal methods b) variable roles c) variable roles + animated simulator which shows roles. 

Conclusion is confusing - raw data looks to me like roles group did worse in their final exam, but author claims that poor grading was the cause.

[Investigating the influence of structure of user performance with UML interaction diagrams](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-kutar.pdf)

Tries again with the two different UML notation. Three different studies show no difference in performance.

[Java Debugging strategies in multi-representational environments](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-romero.pdf)

Java debugger with ghetto eye-tracking. 49 novice students. Given spec and test cases, then given 10 mins in debugger to fix program. 

Numbers are in a different paper. This one only discusses verbalizations from 2 subjects.

Subjects started by reading code almost top-to-bottom. Debugging switched between forward and backward reasoning.

[Little Languages for Little Robots](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-jadud.pdf)

Teaching language design by working with students to build a language for programming Mindstorms robots.

[Software Effort Estimation: unstructured group discussion as a method to reduce individual biasis](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-molokken.pdf)

Groups of programmers produce less over-optimistic estimates than individual programmers (effect size 1.25).

Seems similar to proposed mechanism in Superforecasters - if estimate is ideal time + list of things-that-might-go-wrong, then compiling things-that-might-go-wrong from whole group should provide better coverage.

[Some parallels between empirical software engineering and research in human computer interaction](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-segal.pdf)

Current experiments in psych-prog do not inform practice. HCI faced similar criticism in previous decades and changed focus from lab experiments to field studies. 

[Team coordination through externalised mental imagery](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-petre.pdf)

Several observed cases of mental imagery originating in one dev and spreading throughout an entire team.

Scheme for grading student explanations of programs.

[Using cognitive dimensions to compare prototyping techniques](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-dearden.pdf)

CD analysis suggests that existing categorization of prototyping tools into lo- and hi-fidelity is not enough. 

Identifies 4 key activities: authoring, validation, implementation, confirmation. Not clear how these relate to categorization.

[Using laddering and on-line self-report to elicit design rationale for software](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-sherlock.pdf)

Design rationale may not be available as explicit, conscious, verbalizable knowledge. 

Authors elicit rationale from students designing web pages using real-time self-reporting and laddering. (Laddering seems similar to root-cause analysis, but for exploring knowledge rather than causes).

[Using the cognitive dimensions framework to measure the usability of a class library](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2003-PPIG-15th-clarke.pdf)

Suggests a variant CD specifically designed for evaluating libraries.

Collected program snippets from Java mailing lists (mostly from bug reports and patches). Don't really follow the results.

[Factors affecting course outcomes in introductory programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2004-PPIG-16th-wiedenbeck.pdf)

75 students. Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale questionnaire. Program comprehension test. Program recall test. Weak correlations between self-efficacy at end of course and test scores. 

[Evaluating algorithm animation for concurrent systems: a comprehension-based approach](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2004-PPIG-16th-hughes.pdf)

Proposes evaluating understanding of concurrent systems with a particular talk-aloud protocol and coding system.

[Comparison of three eye tracking devices in psychology of programming research](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2004-PPIG-16th-nevalainen.pdf)

3 commercial eye-trackers. 12 subjects given program comprehension tests. Head-mounted device took longer to setup and was less accurate but allowed subjects to move around.

[Aspects of cognitive style and programming](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2004-PPIG-16th-mancy.pdf)

~150 students. Modified Witkin field-dependency test. Digit span test for working memory. Correlation to exam results 0.1-0.2 for working memory, 0.2-0.4 for field-independency.

(Would effect of field-independency be explained away by spatial IQ?)

[An Inter-Rater Reliability Analysis of Good's Program Summary Analysis Scheme](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2004-PPIG-16th-byckling.pdf)

Coding scheme for program summaries shows ~80% agreement between 3 users. Suggests refinements to the scheme to reduce differences. 

[An Examination of E-Commerce Homepage Design Guidelines by Measuring Eye Movements](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2004-PPIG-16th-tzanidou.pdf)

11 subjects visit ecommerce pagers under eye-tracker. Self-reported data agreed with eye-tracker - users look at top-left or top-middle first.
