WIP DO NOT SHARE

I specialize in high-performance data processing. I can help you cut operational costs, reduce maintenance burden and build simpler, more robust systems.

I'm particularly interested in leveraging Rust and Julia to outperform the competition, and I have several years of production experience in each.

I also have years of experience in designing and building query languages, compilers, databases and IDE tooling.

> Jamie is a first principles thinker with a deep understanding of systems and algorithms. He is fearless in the way he approaches problems. Jamieâ€™s research on staged compilation saved our team many person years of effort, and his training and support was crucial to our adoption of Julia. I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again soon

> Jamie took over the latexsearch engine, our most technically challenging project to date, and turned it from a foundering prototype into a successful service with over 200k users. His engine required only one small server and ran uninterrupted for over 5 years with no errors.
