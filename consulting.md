WIP DO NOT SHARE

I specialize in systems engineering and performance optimization. I can help you:

* process big data without building an expensive distributed system
* replace complex hand-coded data pipelines with simple declarative languages
* improve response times and reduce server expenses for your web service
* use web assembly to speed up your web app
* train your team in Rust or Julia

> Jamie is a first principles thinker with a deep understanding of systems and algorithms. He is fearless in the way he approaches problems. Jamieâ€™s research on staged compilation saved our team many person years of effort, and his training and support was crucial to our adoption of Julia. I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again soon.

> Jamie took over the latexsearch engine, our most technically challenging project to date, and turned it from a foundering prototype into a successful service with over 200k users. His engine required only one small server and ran uninterrupted for over 5 years with no errors.
