WIP DO NOT SHARE

I specialize in high-performance data processing. I can help you cut operational costs, reduce maintenance burden and build simpler, more robust systems.

I'm particularly interested in leveraging Rust and Julia to outperform the competition, and I have several years of production experience in each.

I also have years of experience in designing and building query languages, compilers, databases and interfaces.

> Jamie took over the latexsearch engine, our most technically challenging project to date, and turned it from a foundering prototype into a successful service with over 200k users. His engine required only one small server and ran uninterrupted for over 5 years with no errors.

I'm based in London but happy to work remotely too.
